I'm not fully understand the question. RDMA resources are static and
won't be recalculated dynamically for running cgroups consumers while
new cgroup is started. In this situation, weights and percentages are
the same.

More easy is to summarize requirements:
1. It needs to be convenient for users.
2. It can limit any future objects without change in user tools.
