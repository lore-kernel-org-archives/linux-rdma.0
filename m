Hi Anna-

These are ready for you to consider for v4.10. This patch series makes
the following changes:

- Support for devices that support SG_GAP
- Several bug fixes
- A number of clean-ups and optimizations

SG_GAP devices allow the client transport implementation to register
non-contiguous memory regions using one offset and handle. Scatter
and gather from these regions are then managed entirely in hardware.

Normally a Reply chunk for a READDIR or GETACL is built of multiple
RDMA segments. Now, when our client wants to build a Reply chunk out
of the xdr_buf's head, page list, and tail, it appears to the server
as a single contiguous RDMA segment if the device supports SG_GAP.

Instead of a separate Write WR for each of several RDMA segments,
the server can then post a single Write WR to transmit the whole RPC
Reply (assuming the Reply is smaller than the server RNIC's max_sge)
and can invalidate the whole Reply chunk remotely.

SG_GAP is currently supported by mlx5 devices when using the FRWR
registration mechanism.
