I don't think user space developers will be happy having to do trial an=

error to determine what features the kernel driver supports. It might b=
e=20
even more then O(log2(N)). If my understanding of comp_mask bits usage =

it's the fact that it requires user-space developers to go through hoop=

It is my understanding that each comp_mask bit marks a set of fields in=
=20
the command or in the response struct as valid, so the struct format=20
remains the same and the kernel and userspace don't need to make=20
difficult calculation as to where each field is, but you can still pass=
=20
a high bit set in comp_mask with one of the lower bits cleared.

I couldn't find this explicit detail in the mailing list, but I did fou=
nd
a presentation that was presented in OFA International Developer=20
Workshop 2013 [1], that gave an example of of an verb where each=20
comp_mask bit marked a different field as valid.

I understand this position, and I generally agree, but I think that=20
specifically for a verb like QUERY_DEVICE that only reads information f=
rom=20
the kernel driver to user-space, there is no harm in the kernel just=20
providing all the information it can fit in the response buffer provide=
d=20
by user-space.

Let me explain: newer fields are added to the kernel response struct at=
 the=20
end, together with a new comp_mask bit.

Older user-space with newer kernels will simply ask only for the buffer=
=20
size they care about. The fact that the struct is truncated doesn't aff=
ect
these programs because the truncated struct is a valid struct that was=20
presented by the kernel in an older version.

They may or may not receive a comp_mask bit they don't recognize, but t=
hat=20
only tells them that the kernel supports new features they don't know a=
bout.

Newer user-space with older kernel will give a larger buffer then the=20
kernel can fill. The kernel only fills in the beginning of the user-spa=
ce=20
buffer, and provides user-space with the comp_mask bits that mark which
fields are valid. So user-space can tell that the end of the buffer isn=
't=20
valid.=20

In my implementation I also left the ending uninitialized, but the=20
kernel can zero it if you think it is important.

So I hope you agree this scheme is extendible and allows keeping backwa=
rd=20
and forward compatibility. If you can think of another scheme that will=
 be=20
more strict with the buffer sizes, but doesn't require user-space to do=
=20
extra work, I'll be happy to hear about it.

Haggai
