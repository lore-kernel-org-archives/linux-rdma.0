Just to comment on this, any infiniband driver which use umem and do
not have ODP (here ODP for me means listening to mmu notifier so all
infiniband driver except mlx5) will be affected by same issue AFAICT.

AFAICT there is no special thing happening after fork() inside any of
those driver. So if parent create a umem mr before fork() and program
hardware with it then after fork() the parent might start using new
page for the umem range while the old memory is use by the child. The
reverse is also true (parent using old memory and child new memory)
bottom line you can not predict which memory the child or the parent
will use for the range after fork().

So no matter what you consider the child or the parent, what the hw
will use for the mr is unlikely to match what the CPU use for the
same virtual address. In other word:

Before fork:
    CPU parent: virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xCAFE
    HARDWARE:   virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xCAFE

Case 1:
    CPU parent: virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xCAFE
    CPU child:  virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xDEAD
    HARDWARE:   virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xCAFE

Case 2:
    CPU parent: virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xBEEF
    CPU child:  virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xCAFE
    HARDWARE:   virtual addr ptr1 -> physical address = 0xCAFE


This apply for every single page and is not predictable. This only
apply to private memory (mmap() with MAP_PRIVATE)

I am not familiar enough with RDMA user space API contract to know
if this is an issue or not.

Note that this can not be fix, no one should have done umem without
ODP like mlx5. For this to work properly you need sane hardware like
mlx5.

Jérôme
