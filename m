The abstraction is 10+ years old.  It has had plenty of time to ferment
and something better for the specific use case has not emerged.

No.  And if you think this, then you miss the *entire* point of RDMA
technologies.  An analogy that I have used many times in presentations
is that, in the networking world, the kernel is both a postman and a
copy machine.  It receives all incoming packets and must sort them to
the right recipient (the postman job) and when the user space
application is ready to use the information it must copy it into the
user's VM space because it couldn't just put the user's data buffer on
the RX buffer list since each buffer might belong to anyone (the copy
machine).  In the RDMA world, you create a new queue pair, it is often a
long lived connection (like a socket), but it belongs now to the app and
the app can directly queue both send and receive buffers to the card and
on incoming packets the card will be able to know that the packet
belongs to a specific queue pair and will immediately go to that apps
buffer.  You can *not* do this with TCP without moving to complete TCP
offload on the card, registration of specific sockets on the card, and
then allowing the application to pre-register receive buffers for a
specific socket to the card so that incoming data on the wire can go
straight to the right place.  If you ever get to the point of "OS
schedules the transfer" then you might as well throw RDMA out the window
because you have totally trashed the benefit it provides.

Not really.  If you are going to have a bare abstraction, this one isn't
really a bad one.  You have devices.  On a device, you allocate
protection domains (PDs).  If you don't care about cross connection
issues, you ignore this and only use one.  If you do care, this acts
like a process's unique VM space only for RDMA buffers, it is a domain
to protect the data of one connection from another.  Then you have queue
pairs (QPs) which are roughly the equivalent of a socket.  Each QP has
at least one Completion Queue where you get the events that tell you
things have completed (although they often use two, one for send
completions and one for receive completions).  And then you use some
number of memory registrations (MRs) and address handles (AHs) depending
on your usage.  Since RDMA stands for Remote Direct Memory Access, as
you can imagine, giving a remote machine free reign to access all of the
physical memory in your machine is a security issue.  The MRs help to
control what memory the remote host on a specific QP has access to.  The
AHs control how we actually route packets from ourselves to the remote ho=
st.

Here's the deal.  You might be able to create an abstraction above this
that hides *some* of this.  But it can't hide even nearly all of it
without loosing significant functionality.  The problem here is that you
are thinking about RDMA connections like sockets.  They aren't.  Not
even close.  They are "how do I allow a remote machine to directly read
and write into my machines physical memory in an even remotely close to
secure manner?"  These resources aren't hardware resources, they are the
abstraction resources needed to answer that question.
