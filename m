I mentioned pNFS briefly only as an example. There have
been a variety of proposals and approaches so far, and
it's time, I believe, to start focusing our efforts.

Thus I'm requesting a "broader architectural discussion
about how to overcome issues with the use of persistent
memory for NAS," in particular how we'd like to do this
with the Linux implementations of the iSER, SRP, and
NFS/RDMA protocols using DAX/pmem or NVM[ef].

It is not going to be like the well-worn paradigm that
involves a page cache on the storage target backed by
slow I/O operations. The protocol layers on storage
targets need a way to discover memory addresses of
persistent memory that will be used as source/sink
buffers for RDMA operations.

And making data durable after a write is going to need
some thought. So I believe some new plumbing will be
necessary.

I know this is not everyone's cup of tea. A BoF would
be fine, if the PC believes that is a better venue (and
I'm kind of leaning that way myself).
