No.  And iWARP devices must support READ_WITH_INV from my reading of the iWARP verbs spec.  

I will add all these comments and make use of READ_WITH_INV.

Did you mean "only impacts iWARP?"  

Yes the patch takes care of sg->fr page list packing. And it uses the existing isert_map_fr_pagelist() to pack the sg into the
fastreg page list.  This same routine is used by the IB FRMR/PI reg/unreg routines as well.

None of this impacts isert over IB, assuming the suggested change above to only use the new reg/unreg functions for devices that
need the iwarp style of read. IE IB devices will either use the existing FRMR/PI methods if they support FRMR/LOCAL_DMA_LKEY/PI
(mlx5) or they will use the existing DMA_MR methods (all the rest of the IB devices).  IW devices will get my new reg/unreg
methods...

Steve.
