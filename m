Almost. Not yet a wire protocol, Just an high level functionality description.
first. But yes a wire protocol in the sense that I want an open source library
that will be good for Kernel and Usermode. Any none Linux platform should be
able to port the code base and use it.
That said at some early point we should lock the wire protocol for inter version
compatibility or at least have a fixture negotiation when things get evolved.

Ok Thanks for bringing this up.

So there is two separate issues here. Which are actually not related to the
above API. It is more an Initiator issue. Since once the server did the above
map_virtual_address() and return a key to client machine it is out of the way.

On the initiator what we do is: All RDMA async sends. Once the user did an fsync
we do a sync-read(0, 1); so to guaranty both initiator and Server's nicks flush all
write buffers, to Server's PCIE controller.

But here lays the problem: In modern servers the PCIE/memory_controller chooses
to write fast PCIE data (or actually any PCI data) directly to L3 cache on the
principal that receiving application will access that memory very soon.
This is what is called DDIO.
Now here there is big uncertainty. and we are still investigating. The only working
ADR machine we have with an old NvDIMM-type-12 legacy BIOS. (All the newer type-6
none NFIT BIOS systems never worked and had various problems with persistence)
So that only working system, though advertised as DDIO machine does not exhibit
the above problem.
	On a test of RDMA-SEND x X; RDMA-READ(0,1); POWER-OFF;
We always are fine and never get a compare error between the machines.
[I guess it depends on the specific system and the depth of the ADR flushing
 on power-off, there are 15 milliseconds of power to work with]

But the Intel documentation says different. And it says that in a DDIO system
persistence is not Guaranteed.

There are two ways to solve this:
1. Put a remote procedure on the passive machine that will do a CLFLUSH of
   all written regions. We hate that in our system and will not want to do
   so, this is CPU intensive and will kill our latencies.
   So NO!
2. Disable the DDIO for the NIC we use for storage.
   [In our setup we can do this because there is a 10G management NIC for
    regular trafic, and a 40/100G Melanox card dedicated to storage, so for
    the storage NIC DDIO may be disabled. (Though again it makes not difference
    for us because in our lab with or without it works the same)
   ]
3. There is a future option that we asked Intel to do, which we should talk about
   here. Set a per packet HEADER flag which says DDIO-off/on, and a way for the
   PCIE card to enforce it. Intel guys where positive for this initiative and said
   They will support it in the next chipsets.
   But I do not have any specifics on this option.

For us. Only option two is viable right now.

In any way to answer your question at the Initiator we assume that after a sync-read
of a single byte from an RDMA channel, all previous writes are persistent.
[With the DDIO flag set to off when 3. is available]

But this is only the very little Information I was able to gather and the
little experimentation we did here in the lab. A real working NvDIMM ADR
system is very scarce so far and all Vendors came out short for us with
real off-the-shelf systems.
	I was hoping you might have more information for me.

OK I will let our RDMA guy Yigal Korman answer that, I guess you might be right.

But regardless of this little detail we would like to keep everything 2M. Yes
virtually on the wire protocol. But even on the Server Internal configuration
we would like to see a single TLB 2M mapping of all Target's pmem. Also on the
PCIE it is nice a scatter-list with 2M single entry, instead of the 4k.
And I think it is nice for DAX systems to fallocate and guaranty 2M contiguous
allocations of heavy accessed / mmap files.

Thank you for your interest.
