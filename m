Hello, Parav.

Sorry about the delay.

Yes, when you're locking up to the root each time, splitting locks at
the bottom doesn't really achieve anything.  It just makes things more
expensive.

Hmmm... can you please try to refactor the common part to helpers?
It's not a big thing but there were both styles across different
controllers and helper based ones tend to be easier to follow.

I see, but if that's the case, please drop the fine locking.  The fine
locking doesn't make much sense - as implemented it's slower and the
whole thing is not hot.

Thanks.
