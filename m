Jason,

We have protocol that involves remote memory keys transfer in their
standards so I don't see how we can remove it altogether from ULPs.

Putting that aside,

My main problem with this approach is that once you do non-trivial
things such as memory registration completely under the hood, it is
a slippery slope for device drivers.

If say a driver decides to register memory without the caller knowing,
it would need to post an extra work request on the send queue. So once
it sees the completion, it needs to silently consume it and have some
non trivial logic to invalidate it (another work request!) either from
poll_cq context or another thread.

Moreover, this also means that the driver needs to allocate bigger send
queues for possible future memory registration (depending on the IO
pattern maybe). And I really don't like an API that instructs the user
"please allocate some extra room in your send queue as I might need it".

This would also require the drivers to take a huristic approach on how
much memory registration resources are needed for all possible
consumers (ipoib, sdp, srp, iser, nfs, more...) which might have
different requirements.

I know that these are implementation details, but the point is that
vendor drivers can easily become a complete mess. I think we should
try to find a balanced approach where both consumers and providers are
not completely messed up.

Sagi.
