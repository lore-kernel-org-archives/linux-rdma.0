Recall that if there's no file data, the transport will
utilize a persistently registered and DMA mapped buffer
that it owns in which to build the RPC Call message and
post the Send.

If there is file data, the same buffer is used, but the
memory containing the file data is DMA mapped and added
to the Send SGE list.

With sendctx, every 16th Send [*] is signaled whether it
is carrying extra SGEs that need to be unmapped, or not.
All other Sends are not signaled. This guarantees correct
Send Queue accounting for all workloads and registration
modes, using a minimum number of completions.

During each Send completion, the handler walks through
SGEs since the last completion, and unmaps them if needed.

If we choose never to do scatter-gather Send with file
data, then this last step is unneeded because then only
persistently registered and mapped buffers would be used
for sending RPC Call messages.

But note that either mechanism results in the same Send
completion rate.


[*] 16 is adjusted down to accommodate smaller Send
Queues as needed.

I'm told that not letting the hardware try as hard as it
can to transmit a Send is asking for data corruption. Thus
the current setting is 6. That should cause a time out in
less than a minute? It depends on the HCA I guess.

Dropping the connection is desirable to force a full
reconnect (with address resolution) and to kick off
another Send. It is not desirable because it will also
interrupt all other outstanding RPCs on that connection.

As I see it, the options are to apply sendctx (this series),
and then:

A. Remove the post-v4.6 scatter-gather code, or

B. Force RPC completion to wait for Send completion, which
would allow the post-v4.6 scatter-gather code to work
safely. This would need some guarantee that Sends will
always complete in a short period.

For B, the signaling scheme would have to be: signal
non-data-bearing Send every so often, but signal all
data-bearing Sends. RPC completion would have to be able
to tell the difference and wait as needed. I can probably
handle this by adding a couple of atomic bits in struct
rpcrdma_req.

A. seems like the more straightforward approach.
