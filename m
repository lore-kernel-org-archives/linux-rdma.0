== Performance results ==

This is NFSv3 / RDMA, CX-3 Pro (FRWR) on a 12-core dual-socket
client and an 8-core single-socket server. The exported fs is a
tmpfs. Note that iozone reports latency for a system call, not
RPC round-trip.

Test #1: The inline threshold is set to 1KB, and Remote Invalidation
is disabled (RPC-over-RDMA Version One baseline).

    O_DIRECT feature enabled
    Microseconds/op Mode. Output is in microseconds per operation.

Test #2: The inline threshold is set to 4KB, and Remote Invalidation
is enabled. This means I/O payloads smaller than about 3.9KB do not
use explicit RDMA at all, and no LOCAL_INV WR is needed for operations
that do use RDMA.

== Analysis ==

To understand these results, note that:

Typical round-trip latency in this configuration for LOOKUP, ACCESS
and GETATTR (which bear no data payload) is 30-35us.

- An NFS READ call is a pure inline RDMA Send
- A small NFS READ reply is a pure inline RDMA Send
- A large NFS READ reply is an RDMA Write followed by an RDMA Send

- A small NFS WRITE call is a pure inline RDMA Send
- A large NFS WRITE call is an RDMA Send followed by the
server doing an RDMA Read
- An NFS WRITE reply is a pure inline RDMA Send

In Test #2, the 1KB and 2KB I/Os are all pure inline. No explicit
RDMA operation is involved. At 4KB and above, explicit RDMA is used
with a single STag. The server invalidates each RPC's STag, so no
LOCAL_INV WR is needed on the client for Test #2.

The key take-aways are that:

- For small payloads, NFS READ using RDMA Write with Remote
Invalidation is nearly as fast as pure inline; both modes take
about 40usec per RPC

- The NFS READ improvement with Remote Invalidation enabled is
effective even at 8KB payloads and above, but 10us is relatively
small compared to other transmission costs

- For small payloads, the RDMA Read round-trip still adds
significant per-WRITE latency
