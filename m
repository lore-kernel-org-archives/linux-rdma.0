This registration strategy was not removed. It is available and used
when the underlying HCA does not support either FRWR or FMR, or it
can be selected via sysctl.

I chose to leave it in for testing purposes. I know Christoph would
like to see it removed because of the security issues you mention
above. Others have asked that it be retained.

Certainly I can remove it as a fallback choice, leaving it so that
it can only be selected by sysctl.
