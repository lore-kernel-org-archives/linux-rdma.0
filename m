I probably didn't explain it well in previous email. Let me try again
and see if it make sense.
Whenever resource is allocated, it belongs to a given rdma cgroup.
Whenever its freed, its freed from same rdma cgroup.
(even if the original allocating process is terminated or the original
cgroup is offline now).

Every time a new resource is allocated, its current rdma cgroup is
being considered for allocation.

IB stack keeps the resource ownership with the pid (tgid) structure
and holds reference count to it, so that even if original process is
terminated, its pid structure keeps hovering around until last
resource is freed.

Above functionality is achieved, by maintaining the map this tgid and
associated original cgroup at try_charge(), uncharge() time.

In alternate method,
Its simple to store the pointer of rdma_cgroup structure in the IB
resource structure and hold on reference count to rdma_cgroup.
so that when its freed, uncharge_resource can accept rdma_cgroup
structure pointer.
This method will eliminate current pid map infrastructure all together
and achieve same functionality as described above.

try_charge() would return pointer to rdma_cg or NULL based on
successful charge, or fail respectively.
uncharge() will have rdma_cg as input argument.
Are you ok with that approach?
