The whole point is to make it somewhat restrictive so that low level
drivers don't go crazy with it and the defined resources are clearly
identified and documented.

So, I'm really not gonna go for individual drivers defining resources
on their own.  That's a trainwreck waiting to happen.  There needs to
be a lot more scrutiny than that.

So, in terms of user interface, it doesn't buy anything, right?  It's
generally a bad idea to mix implementation details like "checking 10+
elems on free" with interface decisions.  If the overhead of scanning
the array matters, it can easily be resolved by keeping the count of
non-max values.

It could be that setting all attributes to "max" is inconvenient from
interface POV (I don't think this would be a common use case tho).  If
so, please justify that, update the interface conventions along with
other similar knobs.  Don't introduce one-off custom thing.

You don't need object type for that.  Think about it again.  All you
need is a refcnt and cgroup already has a facility for that.

Thanks.
