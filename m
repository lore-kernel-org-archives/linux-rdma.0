I cannot forsee the future, but having at least one unused bit
available allow for any kind of yet unknown extension: having this
bit/these bits checked now, permit fixing mistake later.

So let it be.

Thanks.

It seems to me it has the layout you're expecting:

    224 struct ib_uverbs_ex_query_device_resp {
    225         struct ib_uverbs_query_device_resp base;
    226         __u32 comp_mask;
    227         __u32 reserved;
    228         struct ib_uverbs_odp_caps odp_caps;
    229 };

Regards.
