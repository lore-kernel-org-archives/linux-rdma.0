They're basically the same concept, it's a subtle difference.

FRMR = Fast Register Memory Region
FRWR = Fast Register Work Request

The memory region is the mr itself, this is created early on.

The work request is built when actually binding the physical
pages to the region, and setting the offset, length, etc, which
is what's happening in the routine that I made the comment on.

So, for this discussion I chose to say FRWR. Sorry for any
confusion!

Tom.
