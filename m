I agree, keeping the current semantics is probably the best thing we
could do. It's a trade-off between breaking existing applications,
having a new lease API for DAX or just failing DAX in particular (as
opposed to other cases). For stable mappings, what we have is probably
sufficient. For mappings which could be changed, it's unclear to me
how you could guarantee non-racy behavior that is bounded by a
pre-defined time and guarantee no user-space errors. On top of that,
ODP (should) already solve that problem transparently.

IMHO, using iommu for that and causing DMA errors just because the
lease broke isn't the right thing to do.
