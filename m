As I recall, didn't the NFSoRDMA stack do even worse in the beginning
(meaning it previously had a memory model that was simply "register all
memory on the client and pass the rkey to the server and then tell the
server when/where to read/write", which was subsequently removed in
Chuck's NFSoRDMA cleanups over the last 5 or so kernel versions)?

I'm not bringing this up to downplay the current iSER issue, but to
demonstrate that we have long had a different trust model than the one
in RFC5042.  More below on that.

Are there security issues?  Yes.  Are we going to solve them in this
patch set?  No.  Especially since those security issues extend beyond
iSER + iWARP.

There are currently 4 RDMA capable link types/protocols.  Of those 4, 3
enforce locality (IB, OPA, RoCE all require lossless fabrics and cannot
be sent out into the wild internet).  RFC5042 is written with iWARP in
mind because it *can* be sent out over the Internet and therefore it is
possible for someone to place an RNIC card directly on the Internet and
it must therefore deal with all of the attack vectors this entails.

The linux RDMA stack, as a whole, is no where near RFC5042 compliant.
And it isn't just the kernel space at fault here.  Early versions of
opensm used to require that the master and slave machines must have
passwordless root ssh access to each other to copy around the guid2lid
file so when the master failed over, the slave would have an up to date
list.

Because 3 of the 4 RDMA technology types enforce localized clusters, the
majority of the stack and the implementations have utilized the cluster
as the point of trust.  In truth, I think it's simply been the easy way
to do things.  RFC5042 is very clearly a non-trust model where each
machine, and each connection, is assumed to be a threat.

So, long story short(ish):

While this discussion is taking place in the cleanup thread, part of it
involves the preceding patch set: iSER support for iWARP.  Patch 4/5 in
the iSER/iWARP series enables the remote write on device->mr
registration which constitutes the security issue we've been discussing.
 This cleanup patch set, then, is merely guilty of hiding that security
issue, not introducing it.

I think Steve and the other iSER folks should consider the wisdom of
including the iWARP support as it stands.  If they think that the common
use case is in a sequestered cluster, and that the current trust domain
is already not RFC5042 compliant, then I'm OK with enabling iSER support
for iWARP, but I would want there to be a very clear warning in the
dmesg about the trust domain issue.  I might even suggest that the iSER
driver, at least on iWARP connections, could possibly check the src/dst
addresses to make sure that they are in a private IP domain and if they
aren't, refuse to create a connection while emitting an additional
warning about the trust domain.

As far as the cleanup patches are concerned, I'm OK with those too.
However, since we would have added a large warning in the iSER code
about this issue, and that would then go away with the cleanup, the
warning would need to be generalized (such as "module <foo> is
requesting insecure iWARP mappings"), and appropriately WARN_ONCEd on
probably a per module basis or something like that.

=46rom there, we can start to look at the bigger picture of cleanup up th=
e
default trust domain in the kernel and user space both (and soliciting
feedback on that...I have a suspicion that some users will not like us
tightening up security as it might interfere with their usage in their
sequestered clusters).
