Just read it.  Much appreciated.

It's kinda bothering that all these are disparate resources.  I
suppose that each restriction comes from the underlying hardware and
there's no accepted higher level abstraction for these things?

I'm doubtful that these things are gonna be mainstream w/o building up
higher level abstractions on top and if we ever get there we won't be
talking about MR or CQ or whatever.  Also, whatever next-gen is
unlikely to have enough commonalities when the proposed resource knobs
are this low level, so let's please keep it separate, so that if/when
this goes out of fashion for one reason or another, the controller can
silently wither away too.

I don't think that jives with the rest of cgroup and what generic
block or pcie attributes are directly exposed to applications and need
to be hierarchically controlled via cgroup?

Thanks.
