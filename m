I also feel that would be a healthy direction.

There is also Memory Windows, but there may no longer be any
kernel consumers of that memory registration method.

Code review has shown the remaining ib_reg_phys_mr() call in xprtrdma
is never reached in the current code, and thus it will be removed
very soon.

There is one remaining kernel user of ib_reg_phys_mr() in 4.2: Lustre.
