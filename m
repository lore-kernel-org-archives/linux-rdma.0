Yes, it does the same.

Ok, effectively user will see "failed to reconnect" messages in syslog
until it succeeds. I think if the syslog messages displays a valid reason
then we are covered here.

Makes sense, I agree with you here.

Yes

Ok, lets wait for Christoph's patch in NFS server. Till then I agree
with your decision on this patch.
