So, I was originally of the view the flags change was fine.

But when I realized that it basically hides a
ib_get_dma_mr(IB_ACCESS_REMOTE_WRITE) behind an opaque API:

 rdma_get_dma_mr(RDMA_MRR_READ_DEST)

I changed my mind.

For iWarp the above creates a rkey that can RDMA WRITE to any place in
system memory. If a remote guesses that rkey your system is totally
compromised. So it is insecure, and contrary to the advice in RFC5042.

Seeing rdma_get_dma_mr(RDMA_MRR_READ_DEST) added all over the code
base terrifies me, because it is utterly wrong, and looks harmless.

The mistep, is that enabling iSER for iWarp is not just this trivial
change:

-	device->mr = ib_get_dma_mr(device->pd, IB_ACCESS_LOCAL_WRITE);
+	mr_roles = RDMA_MRR_RECV | RDMA_MRR_SEND | RDMA_MRR_WRITE_SOURCE |
+		   RDMA_MRR_READ_DEST;
+	device->mr = rdma_get_dma_mr(device->pd, mr_roles, 0);

But, it must also follow the path of NFS and use FRMR on iWarp for
RDMA READ lkeys. This is the real quirk of iWarp, not that the MR
flags are slightly different.

>From there, it is a logical wish: If Steve is going to FRMR'ize iSER
to be acceptable security wise, I'd rather see that work done on in a
general way. Hence the API discussion.

What do you think?
