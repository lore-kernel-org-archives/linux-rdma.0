I would assume so too...

Well, no RDMA application can really do this, unless you set the
timeout to multiple minutes, on par with network timeouts.

Again, these details are why I think this kind of DAX and non ODP-MRs
are probably practically not too useful for a production system. Great
for test of course, but in that case SIGKILL would be fine too...

Yes. The MR's are associated with an fd. When the fd is closed
ib_uverbs_close triggers ib_uverbs_cleanup_ucontext which runs through
all the objects, including MRs, and deletes them.

The specification for deleting a MR requires a synchronous fence with
the hardware. After MR deletion the hardware will not DMA to any pages
described by the old MR, and those pages will be unpinned.

Well, you'd have to code something in the MR code to keep track of DAX
MRs and issue an out of band invalidate to impacted MRs to create the
fence.

This probably needs some driver work, I'm not sure if all the hardware
can do out of band invalidate to any MR or not..

Generally speaking, in RDMA, when a new feature like this comes along
we have to push a lot of the work down to the driver authors, and the
approach has historically been that new features only work on some
hardware (as much as I dislike this, it is pragmatic)

So, not being able to support DAX on certain RDMA hardware is not
an unreasonable situation in our space.
