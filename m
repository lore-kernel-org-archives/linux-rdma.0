We have to keep that logic, since a spurious disconnect
will result in flushed LOCAL_INV requests too. In fact
that's the by far more likely source of inconsistent MRs.

I'm preparing to extend the frwr_queue_recovery mechanism
in v4.7 to deal with other cases, and that new code could
be used here to fence MRs, rather than forcing a disconnect.

I'd like to leave 05/11 in place for v4.6.

Anna, can you add Sagi's Reviewed-by tags to the other
patches in this series, as he posted earlier this week?
