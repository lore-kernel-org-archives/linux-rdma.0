No, you do get protection - the IOMMU isn't the only resource, it would
still have to be combined with several pre-setup MR's that have the
proper protection attributes. You'd map the page list into the address
space that is covered by a MR that has the protection attributes
needed.

??? the entire point of using the IOMMU in a context like this is to
linearize the page list into DMA'able address. How could you ever need
to scatter/gather when your memory is linear?

So, I wasn't clear, I mean a general API that can post a SEND or RDMA
WRITE using a logically linear page list as the data source.

So this results in one of:
 1) A SEND with a gather list
 2) A SEND with a temporary linearized MR
 3) A series of RDMA WRITE with gather lists
 4) A RDMA WRITE with a temporary linearized MR

Picking one depends on the performance of the HCA and the various
features it supports. Even just the really simple options of #1 and #3
become a bit more complex when you want to take advantage of
transparent huge pages to reduce gather list length.

For instance, deciding when to trade off 3 vs 4 is going to be very
driver specific..

Right, most likely an implementation would just pull the NFS code into
the core, I think it is the broadest version we have?

I don't mean send+invalidate, this is the 'free' for the 'alloc' the
above APIs might need (ie the temporary MR). You can't fail to free
the MR - that would be an insane API :)

No idea for Linux. It seems to me most of the use cases we are talking
about here not actually assuming a socket, NFS-RDMA, SRP, iSER, Lustre
are all explicitly driving verbs and explicity working with pages
lists for their high speed side.

Does that mean we are already doing what you are talking about?
