I need to think about it. I would like to avoid keep per task resource
counters for two reasons.
For a while I thought that native fork() doesn't take care to share
the RDMA resources and all CQ, QP dmaable memory from PID namespace
perspective.

1. Because, it could well happen that process and its child process is
created in PID namespace_A, after which child is migrated to new PID
namespace_B.
after which parent from the namespace_A is terminated. I am not sure
how the ucontext ownership changes from parent to child process at
that point today.
I prefer to keep this complexity out if at all it exists as process
migration across namespaces is not a frequent event for which to
optimize the code for.

2. by having per task counter (as cost of memory some memory) allows
to avoid using atomic during charge(), uncharge().

The intent is to have per task (process and thread) to have their
resource counter instance, but I can see that its broken where its
charging parent process as of now without atomics.
As you said its ok to always charge the owner process, I have to relax
2nd requirement and fallback to use atomics for charge(), uncharge()
or I have to get rid of ucontext from the uncharge() API which is
difficult due to fput() being in worker thread context.
