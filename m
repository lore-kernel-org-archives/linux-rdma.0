Not sure I understand, Can you please explain why deregistration will=20
not succeed?
AFAIK You are allowed to register FRMR and then deregister it without=20
having to invalidate it.

Can you please explain why you logically connected LINV with deregistra=
tion?

Why not first create a new id+qp and assign them - and then destroy the=
=20
old id+qp?
see SRP related section: ib_srp.x:srp_create_target_ib()

Anyway it is indeed important to guarantee that no xmit flows happens=20
concurrently to that,
and cleanups are processed synchronously and in-order.

Again, I don't understand why you can't dereg_mr().

How about allocating the FRMR pool *after* the QP was successfully=20
created/connected (makes sense as the FRMRs are
not usable until then), and destroy/cleanup the pool before the QP is=20
disconnected/destroyed. it also makes sense as they
must match PDs.

Agree.
