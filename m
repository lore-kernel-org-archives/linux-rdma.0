Thanks, I appreciate it.

In mlx5 system, we always added 2048 bytes to such allocations, for
reasons unknown to me. And it doesn't seem as a conservative approach
either.

No, I didn't find support for that. Function dma_map_single expects
contiguous memory aligned to cache line, there is no limitation to be
page bounded.

b) the memory region ends on cache line.

I disagree, kmalloc with supplied flags will return contiguous memory
which is enough for dma_map_single. It is cache line alignment.

Thanks, I missed it.
