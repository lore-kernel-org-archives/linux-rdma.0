I will let others comments on it. The patch_v11 design was allowing
vendor specific objects and standard objects to be defined in IB core
and rdma cgroup was facilitator to do so. We didn't reach consensus on
that approach.

Ditto comment as above.

This we can possibly do by having new rdma.percentage knob, which gets
configured by default for every new object in rdma cgroup.
This way average user/administrator doesn't have to know about it.

I didnt follow this comment. Can you please explain? Are you saying
rdma cgroup should have define all the objects of IB spec?

Global object won't work for below reason.
Lets take example that makes life easier.
Lets say two new RDMA objects exist which are not part of rdma cgroup
standard resource definition.
say, indirection table and PSM tags.
Both are abstracted using one global_hca resource object.
Say its given 10%.
Now IB core performs charging of each such object using GLOBAL_HCA.
(Because cgroup level there is only one object GLOBAL_HCA).
So two or more resources are mapped to single object.
Which means, one object can be charged more with total limit still
under 10%, thats leads to same problem as not having cgroup at all.

So my opinion is:
(a) Let cgroup define the current standard objects and new reasonable
set of vendor specific objects in future.
(b) Add new rdma.percentage parameter so that any new standard object
or vendor specific object can be abstracted from average end user and
applications which are yet to catch up.
I believe this takes care of your point (1), (3), (4)?

In other hypothetical design,
we can have rdma group as just pid to cgroup mapping facilitator.
All the charging/uncharging logic moves to IB core in form of library,
that standard ABI uverbs and vendor specific layer invokes. In this
approach there will be code duplicated in every such vendor driver.
By doing so, more callbacks will also have to be moved down till IB
core and vendor drivers for cgroup creation/deletion/offline etc.

This also means that lack of standard object definitions, may creates
more confusion to end user and orchestration applications. I prefer to
avoid such design.
