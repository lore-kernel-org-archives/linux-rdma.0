For everyone who hasn't sent an attend request in, this is a good
example of how not to get an invitation.  When collecting the requests
to attend, the admins tend to fold to the top of thread,  so if you
send a request to attend as a reply to somebody else, it won't be seen
by that process.

You don't need to resend this one, I noticed it, but just in case next
time ...
