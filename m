Yes RDMA as an existing historical track record and thus people
should now be aware of its limitation. What i am fighting against
is new addition to kernel that pretend to do SVA (share virtual
address) while their hardware is not realy doing SVA. SVA with
IOMMU and ATS/PASID is fine, SVA in software with device driver
that abide to mmu notifier is fine. Anything else is not.

So i am just worrying about new user and making sure they under-
stand what is happening and not sell to their user something
false.

Cheers,
Jérôme
