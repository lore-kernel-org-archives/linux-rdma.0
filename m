My uneducated suspicion is that the abstraction is just not developed
enough.  It should be possible to virtualize these resources through,
most likely, time-sharing to the level where userland simply says "I
want this chunk transferred there" and OS schedules the transfer
prioritizing competing requests.

It could be that given the use cases rdma might not need such level of
abstraction - e.g. most users want to be and are pretty close to bare
metal, but, if that's true, it also kinda is weird to build
hierarchical resource distribution scheme on top of such bare
abstraction.

You kinda have to decide that upfront cuz it gets baked into the
interface.

It's still a very low level of abstraction which pretty much gets
decided by what the hardware and driver decide to do.

So, this fits cgroup's purpose to certain level but it feels like
we're trying to build too much on top of something which hasn't
developed sufficiently.  I suppose it could be that this is the level
of development that rdma is gonna reach and dumb cgroup controller can
be useful for some use cases.  I don't know, so, yeah, let's keep it
simple and avoid doing crazy stuff.

Thanks.
