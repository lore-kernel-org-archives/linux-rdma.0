+1. Overview
+
+1-1. What is RDMA controller?
+-----------------------------
+
+RDMA controller allows user to limit RDMA/IB specific resources
+that a given set of processes can use. These processes are grouped usi=
ng
+RDMA controller.
+
+RDMA controller allows operating on resources defined by the IB stack
+which are mainly IB verb resources and in future hardware specific
+well defined resources.
+
+1-2. Why RDMA controller needed?
+--------------------------------
+
+Currently user space applications can easily take away all the rdma de=
vice
+specific resources such as AH, CQ, QP, MR etc. Due to which other appl=
ications
+in other cgroup or kernel space ULPs may not even get chance to alloca=
te any
+rdma resources. This leads to service unavailability.
+
+Therefore RDMA controller is needed through which resource consumption
+of processes can be limited. Through this controller various different=
 rdma
+resources described by IB stack can be accounted.
+
+1-3. How is RDMA controller implemented?
+----------------------------------------
+
+RDMA cgroup allows limit configuration of resources. These resources a=
re not
+defined by the rdma controller. Instead they are defined by the IB sta=
ck.
+This provides great flexibility to allow IB stack to define additional
+resources without any changes to rdma cgroup.
+Rdma cgroup maintains resource accounting per cgroup, per device using
+resource pool structure. Each such resource pool is limited up to
+64 resources in given resource pool by rdma cgroup, which can be exten=
ded
+later if required.
+
+This resource pool object is linked to the cgroup css. Typically there
+are 0 to 4 resource pool instances per cgroup, per device in most use =
cases.
+But nothing limits to have it more. At present hundreds of RDMA device=
s per
+single cgroup may not be handled optimally, however there is no
+known use case for such configuration either.
+
+Since RDMA resources can be allocated from any process and can be free=
d by any
+of the child processes which shares the address space, rdma resources =
are
+always owned by the creator cgroup css. This allows process migration =
from one
+to other cgroup without major complexity of transferring resource owne=
rship;
+because such ownership is not really present due to shared nature of
+rdma resources. Linking resources around css also ensures that cgroups=
 can be
+deleted after processes migrated. This allow progress migration as wel=
l with
+active resources, even though that=E2=80=99s not the primary use case.
+
+Whenever RDMA resource charing occurs, owner rdma cgroup is returned t=
o
+the caller. Same rdma cgroup should be passed while uncharging the res=
ource.
+This also allows process migrated with active RDMA resource to charge
+to new owner cgroup for new resource. It also allows to uncharge resou=
rce of
+a process from previously charged cgroup which is migrated to new cgro=
up,
+even though that is not a primary use case.
+
+Resource pool object is created in following situations.
+(a) User sets the limit and no previous resource pool exist for the de=
vice
+of interest for the cgroup.
+(b) No resource limits were configured, but IB/RDMA stack tries to
+charge the resource. So that it correctly uncharge them when applicati=
ons are
+running without limits and later on when limits are enforced during un=
charging,
+otherwise usage count will drop to negative.
+
+Resource pool is destroyed if it all the resource limits are set to ma=
x
+and it is the last resource getting deallocated.
+
+User should set all the limit to max value if it intents to remove/unc=
onfigure
+the resource pool for a particular device.
+
+IB stack honors limits enforced by the rdma controller. When applicati=
on
+query about maximum resource limits of IB device, it returns minimum o=
f
+what is configured by user for a given cgroup and what is supported by
+IB device.
+
+Following resources can be accounted.
+  uctx		Maximum number of User Contexts
+  pd		Maximum number of Protection domains
+  ah		Maximum number of Address handles
+  mr		Maximum number of Memory Regions
+  mw		Maximum number of Memory Windows
+  cq		Maximum number of Completion Queues
+  srq		Maximum number of Shared Receive Queues
+  qp		Maximum number of Queue Pairs
+  flow		Maximum number of Flows
+
+
+2. Usage Examples
+-----------------
+
+(a) Configure resource limit:
+echo mlx4_0 mr=3D100 qp=3D10 ah=3D2 > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/1/rdma.max
+echo ocrdma1 mr=3D120 qp=3D20 cq=3D10 > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.max
+
+(b) Query resource limit:
+cat /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.max
+#Output:
+mlx4_0 uctx=3Dmax pd=3Dmax ah=3D2 mr=3D100 mw=3Dmax cq=3Dmax srq=3Dmax=
 qp=3D10 flow=3Dmax
+ocrdma1 uctx=3D1 pd=3D5 ah=3D1 mr=3D10 cq=3D10 srq=3Dmax qp=3D20 flow=3D=
max flow=3Dmax
+
+(c) Query current usage:
+cat /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.current
+#Output:
+mlx4_0 uctx=3D1 pd=3D2 ah=3D2 mr=3D95 mw=3D0 cq=3D2 srq=3D0 qp=3D8 flo=
w=3D0
+ocrdma1 uctx=3D1 pd=3D6 ah=3D9 mr=3D20 mw=3D0 cq=3D1 srq=3D0 qp=3D2 fl=
ow=3D0
+
+(d) Delete resource limit:
+echo mlx4_0 mr=3Dmax qp=3Dmax ah=3Dmax > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/1/rdma.ma=
