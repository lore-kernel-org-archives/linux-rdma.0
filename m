Absolutely not. The RPC reply requires upper layer processing at
the server, which involves work requests, context switches, file
system and disk i/o operations, and plain old queuing. RPC replies
typically can be expected in milliseconds from traditional HDDs,
and hundreds of microseconds from SSDs. Storage class memory is
reducing these by two orders of magnitude, but it's still not in
the range of a network round trip.

That's not what we've seen, even on InfiniBand. On adapters such as
iWARP, I will note, the send completion is often generated when
the adapter buffers the outgoing message, and has almost nothing
to do with the remote transport ack.
