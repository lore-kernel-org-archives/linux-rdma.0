It may or may not map to HW resources (for Intel NICs it does not).  Even when HW resources do back the QP, the hardware is limited by how many QPs can realistically be active at any one time, based on how much caching is available in the NIC.

cgroups as it stands today provides resource controls in effective
manner of existing defined resource, such as cpu cycles, memory in
user and kernel space, tcp bytes, IOPS etc.
Similarly RDMA programming model defines its own set of resources
which is used by applications which accesses those resources directly.

What we are debating here is that, RDMA exposing hardware resources is
not correct, and therefore whether a cgroup controller is needed or
not.
There are two points here.
1. Whether RDMA programming model is correct or not which works on
defined resources of IB spec.
2. Assuming that programming model is fine, (because we have actively
maintained IB stack in kernel and adoption of user space components in
OS),
whether we need to control those resources or not via cgroup.

Tejun trying to say that because point_1 is doesn't seem to be right
way to solve problem, point_2 should not be done or done at different
level of abstraction.
More questions/comments in Jason and Sean thread.

Sean,
Even though there is no one to one map of verb-QP to hw-QP, in order
for driver or lower layer to effectively map the right verb-QP to
hw-QP, such vendor specific layer needs to know how is it going to be
used. Otherwise two contending applications for a QP may not get the
right number of hw-QPs to use.

> Trying to limit the number of QPs that an app can allocate, therefore, just limits how much of the address space an app can use.  There's no clear link between QP limits and HW resource limits, unless you assume a very specific underlying implementation.
