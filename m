Good! As you know, we were concerned about it after seeing that
the ib_dma_map_sg() code was unconditionally setting it to the
dma_mapped address. By salting those FFFF's with varying data,
this should give your FRWR regions stronger integrity in addition
to not leaking kernel "addresses" to the wire.
