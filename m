IB modules are kernel loadable modules which are defining the resource.
So array size and their names are not defined at compile time of rdma
cgroup code.
Kernel code also cannot depend on loadable module file either via
inclusion as that in v2 patch.
That leads to crash when loadable modules are upgraded.
V1 patch had IB resources defined in the header file of rdmacg, which
I believe is very restrictive model with evolving rdma stack and
features.
Therefore it will be kept as defined in v3 patch in IB headers (non
compile time for rdma cgroup). So support infrastructure APIs will
continue.

Thats what rpool_ops structure does, allowing to query name strings
and type of it by utilizing the match tokens.

User can unset the configured limit by writing "remove" for a given
device, instead of writing max values for all the resources.
As I explained in cover note and other comment, when its marked for
remove, the resource pool is marked as of default type so that it can
be freed. When all resources are freed, we don't free the rpool
because it holds the configured limit.

I will change to rdmacg_resource. As present we have 24-bit wide resources.
64-bit might not needed in near future. If there are inputs comes from
Intel/Mellanox for this I will bump to 64-bit.
Otherwise I prefer to keep it 32-bit.

As you got in later comment and as I explained above, basically
resource marked as of user type is not freed, until either device goes
away or either user wants to clear the configuration.

Yes, I can make creator non atomic.

config stays, until the resources are allocated. If device is there,
we don't create resource pool for all the created cgroups to save
memory with this little extra code.

This is nice wrapper around find_cg_rpool to write clean code. I would
like to keep it for code readability.
if(rpool) check can be removed, because for this function its going to
be true always.

No. If there is one device and 100 cgroups, we create resource pools
when there is actually any of the process wants to perform charging.
(Instead of creating 100 resource pools just because cgroup exists).
So reference count of the rpool checks that when last resource is
freed, it frees the resource pool, if its allocated as default pool.
If user has configured the pool, than it stays (until device goes away).

> Can device go away while resources are allocated?
No. Thats ensured by the IB stack as following correct sequence of destruction.

What you have described is done in little different way in the
loadable kernel module as explained earlier to let it defined by the
IB stack.
Otherwise this needs to be defined in rdma cgroup header file like my
v0 patch, which I certainly want to avoid.

While we free the entry, we don't grab the lock if the refcnt is not
reached zero.
Please refer to put_cg_rpool that does that.
