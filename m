Hi Chuck,

I've installed this in my cluster and ran a number of simple tests
over a variety of hardware.  For the most part, it's looking much
better than NFSoRDMA looked a kernel or two back, but I can still
trip it up.  All tests were run with rhel7 + current upstream
kernel.

My server was using mlx4 hardware in both IB and RoCE modes.

I tested from mlx4 client in both IB and RoCE modes -> not DOA
I tested from mlx5 client in IB mode -> not DOA
I tested from mthca client in IB mode -> not DOA
I tested from qib client in IB mode -> not DOA
I tested from ocrdma client in RoCE mode -> DOA (cpu soft lockup
  on mount on the client)

I tested nfsv3 -> not DOA
I tested nfsv4 + rdma -> still DOA, but I think this is expected
  as last I knew someone needs to write code for nfsv4 mountd
  over rdma before this will work (as nfsv3 uses a tcp connection
  to do mounting, and then switches to rdma for data transfers
  and nfsv4 doesn't support that or something like that...this
  is what I recall Jeff Layton telling me anyway)

I tested nfsv3 in both IB and RoCE modes with rsize=32768 and
wsize=32768 -> not DOA, reliable, did data verification and passed

I tested nfsv3 in both IB and RoCE modes with rsize=65536 and
wsize=65536 -> not DOA, but not reliable either, data transfers
will stop after a certain amount has been transferred and the
mount will have a soft hang

My data verification was simple (but generally effective in
lots of scenarios):

I had a full linux kernel git repo, with a complete build in it
(totaling a little over 9GB of disk space used) and I would run
tar -cf - linus | tar -xvf - -C <tmpdir> to copy the tree
around (I did copies both on the same mount and on a different
mount that was also NFSoRDMA, including copying from an IB
NFSoRDMA mount to a RoCE NFSoRDMA mount on different mlx4 ports),
and then diff -uprN on the various tree locations to check for
any data differences.

So there's your testing report.  As I said in the beginning, it's
definitely better than it was since it used to oops the server and
I didn't encounter any server side problems this time, only client
side problems.

ToDo items that I see:

Write NFSv4 rdma protocol mount support
Fix client soft mount hangs when rsize/wsize > 32768
Fix DOA of ocrdma driver
