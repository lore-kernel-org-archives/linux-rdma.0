Sorry guys, but arbitrary extensibility for something not finished is the
worst idea ever.  We have two options here:

 a) delay cgroups support until the grand rewrite is done
 b) add it now and deal with the consequences later

That being said, adding random non-Verbs hardwasre to the RDMA core is
the second worst idea ever.  Guess I need to catch up with the
discussion and start using the flame thrower.
