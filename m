Why don't we make the command comp_mask in QUERY_DEVICE zero in both
versions. The behavior of the command with comp_mask =3D 0 will be to
return the maximum amount of data that fits in the response buffer. The
kernel will return -EINVAL if the input command comp_mask is not zero i=
n
the current version.

If in the future we want to alter the behavior or add more input fields
to QUERY_DEVICE, we would use new bits.

I meant that the binary format for an older version is the prefix of th=
e
binary format of the newer version.

I'm not sure that in request you can regard the comp_mask as a hint. I
agree that you need to enforce it in general and reject unknown bits
there (although I thought QUERY_DEVICE would be an exception).

I don't think that the application should handle unknown response bits
as an error. As you wrote, I see these as hints about more data in the
response that the application is free to ignore.

As I said, I think unknown bits in the comp_mask are hints about unknow=
n
fields in the response that can be ignored by the application. However,
I can agree to having the kernel checking the response buffer size as
you wrote, and only setting the valid comp_mask bits.

Does the solution I proposed above satisfy this requirement?
- The kernel validates input size =3D=3D command struct size and
cmd.comp_mask =3D=3D 0.
- The kernel fills as much information as it can fit in the buffer
provided by userspace.
- The kernel marks which fields it was able to fill in the response's
comp_mask.
