Yes, I agree. Creating a writable privileged rmr for the RDMA Read sink
buffer exposes all of physical memory to a simple arithmetic mistake.
This should never be allowed in a production config.

That said, for the use by the NFS/RDMA Server, the risk is significantly
mitigated. The sink MR is never sent to the peer by the NFS upper layer,
it is protected by the connection's PD, and it is enabled only when the
RDMA Read is active. However, the very real risk remains. This should
definitely not be the standard API.

Yep. It's the only safe, correct solution.

Well, it's important to realize that NFS already does the Right Thing.
So it isn't actually an urgent issue. There is time to discuss.
