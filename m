May be yes. Buts in difficult to go through the whole design to shape
up right now.
This is the infrastructure getting build with few capabilities.
I see this as starting point instead of end point.

It can always kill the hoarding process(es), which is holding up the
resources without using it.
Such processes will eventually will get restarted but will not be able
to hoard so much because its been on the radar for hoarding and its
limits have been reduced.

We might be able to get the information as we go along.
Such arbitration and management layer outside (instead of inside) has
more visibility into multiple systems which are part of single cluster
and processes are spreaded across cgroup in each such system.
While a logic inside can manage just a manage a process of single node
which are using multiple cgroups.

In that case we might need to build FUSE style infrastructure.
Frequency for RDMA resource allocation is certainly less than read/write calls.

Yes, I agree.
At this point, its software solution to provide resource isolation in
simple manner which has scope to become adaptive in future.
