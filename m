Jason, I don't disagree that the API can be improved. I have some
responses to your statements below though.

Because the iWARP protocol requires it, which was very much an
intentional decision. It actually is not insecure, as discussed
in detail in RFC5042. However, it is different from Infiniband.

Because NFS desires to have a single code path that works for all
transports. In addition, using the IB dma_mr as an lkey means that
large I/O (common with NFS) would require multiple RDMA Read
operations, when the page list exceeded the local scatter/gather
limit of the device.

That is entirely the wrong layer to address this. It would prevent
reuse of MRs, and require upper layers to be aware that this was
the case - which is exactly the opposite of what you are trying
to achieve.

Are you arguing that all upper layer storage protocols take a single
common approach to memory registration? That is a very different
discussion.

Tom.
