Is this true? I thought mmu_notifiers covered all these cases.

The mm_notifier for A should fire if B causes the physical address of
A's pages to change via COW. 

And this causes the device page tables to re-synchronize.

Looks like the IOMMU code uses mmu_notifier, so it is identical to
IB's ODP. The only difference is that IB tends to have the IOMMU page
table in the device, not in the CPU.

The only case I know if that is different is the new-fangled CAPI
stuff where the IOMMU can directly use the CPU's page table and the
IOMMU page table (in device or CPU) is eliminated.

Anyhow, I don't think a single instance of hardware should justify an
entire new subsystem. Subsystems are hard to make and without multiple
hardware examples there is no way to expect that it would cover any
future use cases.

If all your driver needs is to mmap some PCI bar space, route
interrupts and do DMA mapping then mediated VFIO is probably a good
choice. 

If it needs to do a bunch of other stuff, not related to PCI bar
space, interrupts and DMA mapping (ie special code for compression,
crypto, AI, whatever) then you should probably do what Jerome said and
make a drivers/char/hisillicon_foo_bar.c that exposes just what your
hardware does.

If you have networking involved in here then consider RDMA,
particularly if this functionality is already part of the same
hardware that the hns infiniband driver is servicing.

'computational MRs' are a reasonable approach to a side-car offload of
already existing RDMA support.
