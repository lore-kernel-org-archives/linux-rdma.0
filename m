0 is not the result of the write() syscall, as for extended uverbs
I've ensure the return value of the write() syscall was the size
it was given. See

I don't catch your point: the response can be bigger than the request.

The proposed patch ensure the integrity of the response regarding
comp_mask: if a bit is set in response's comp_mask that means the
related fields are presents (and valid).

So before parsing the response fields, userspace have to check
response's comp_mask: fields access must be protected by correct
check on comp_mask ... but it might be useful for the userspace
developer to clear the response buffer just in case he/she decided
to be lazy with the check.

=46or me, it's better if a bit is set in response's comp_mask by the=20
kernel when the kernel have written something in the related fields=20
even if the those fields are all 0.

Sure. So I think comp_mask is just an overly complicated way of
expressing the version and the size of the response.

OK

>=20

Sure one field can be added later: in such case, one bit of request's
comp_mask will gain the meaning: "request_output field is present in th=
e
request".

Sure.

>=20

It's something we could think of but the extended uverbs is already
merge with the comp_mask field in the request and it cost only 4 bytes,
while allowing us to make mistake on the first iteration of the extende=
d
QUERY_DEVICE uverb (provided we manage to add the check for the field
being 0).
