A write syscall that behaves nothing like write() actually should, so
I don't see why we can't have

resp_len = write(fd,inout_buf,sizeof(input_len));

Returning 0 from write makes no sense at all.

In the fullness of your patchset it will maintain the invariant that
resp_len <= sizeof(input_len)

Which seems OK to me considering what we have to work with, and a
significantly better choice than 0.

It was never the intent that the size should be computed from
comp_mask. If the size is necessary it must be explicit.

In this instance if the size is not returned then libibverbs will have
to zero the entire user buffer before passing it to the kernel,
because it has to ensure any tail for the user app is 0'd.

Remember for santity we want comp mask bits for things that can't be 0
and we want 0 for things that are not set.

struct ib_query_device_ex res;
ibv_query_device_ex(..,res,sizeof(res));

printf("%u",res.foo_cap); // 0 if unsupported is OK
if (res.comp_mask & COMP_BAR)
  printf("%u",res.bar_thingy);  // 0 has meaning, must use COMP_BAR

Ideally we want to minimize the number of COMP bits because it is a
huge burden on the end user to work with them.

In the query context I would be happy enough to just treat the in
bound buffer as uninitialized buffer space, but certainly generally
speaking the comp_mask+size should refer to the structure - so
input/output are not directly related.

Agreed - what I described was an abuse that some early Mellanox
patches for a query_ex included and it was just a shortcut to avoid
defining a dedicated input structure. It seems that same scheme was
copied into these new patches.

In the context of the above scheme the input structure was just this:

struct query_input
{
  u64 requested_output;
};

ie it wasn't actually a comp_mask, it just overlapped the comp_mask
bytes on output.

Such a use was never explicitly documented, and IIRC was never
actually included in libibverbs.

Unless someone has a strong reason we need to do this I am inclined to
think that your interpretation is the better one, and we could always
add a requested_output to the input someday if it became urgent.

In any event, you are right, we can't ingore the input bytes today and
expect to give them meaning tomorrow.

or the kernel treats QUERY_DEVICE as an output only function and never
inspects the in/out buffer at all.

The patches turned out to be unnecessary and were dropped, IIRC.

I have and will, thank you
