CC linux-nfs .. maybe this is obvious to someone there ... Two

In case of no other reply, I would start w/ a socket program (or a
network performance measuring tool) on the interface that does similar
logic as "dd" you described below; that is, send a 256K message in a
fixed number of loops (so total transfer size somewhere close to your
file size) between client and server, followed by comparing the
interrupt counters (cat /proc/interrtups) on both kernels. If the
interrupt count differs as you described, the problem is most likely
with the IB driver, not NFS layer.

I don't know much about ConnectX. Not sure what "IPoIB UD" means ?
"Datagram vs. CM" or "TCP vs. UDP" ?
