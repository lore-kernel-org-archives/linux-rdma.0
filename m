Why not? That seems to fit VFIO's space just fine to me.. You might
need a new upcall to create a full MM registration, but that doesn't
seem unsuited.

Part of the point here is you should try to make sensible revisions to
existing subsystems before just inventing a new thing...

VFIO is deeply connected to the IOMMU, so enabling more general IOMMU
based approache seems perfectly fine to me..

?? why wouldn't the mdev track the queues assigned using the existing
open/close/ioctl callbacks?

That is basic flow I would expect:

 open(/dev/vfio)
 ioctl(unity map entire process MM to mdev with IOMMU)

 // Create a HQ queue and link the PASID in the HW to this HW queue
 struct hw queue[..];
 ioctl(create HW queue)

 // Get BAR doorbell memory for the queue
 bar = mmap()

 // Submit work to the queue using CPU addresses
 queue[0] = ...
 writel(bar [..], &queue);

 // Queue, SVA, etc is cleaned up when the VFIO closes
 close()

Presumably the kernel has to handle the PASID and related for security
reasons, so they shouldn't go to userspace?

If there is something missing in vfio to do this is it looks pretty
small to me..
