Yes, that is the idea. And since Jean is merging the AMD and Intel solution
together, I assume they can do the same. This is also the reason I want to solve
my problem on top of IOMMU directly. But anyway, let me try to see if I can
merge the logic with ODP.

It is already part of Jean's patchset. And that's why I built my solution on
VFIO in the first place. But I think the concept of SVA and PASID is not
compatible with the original VFIO concept space. You would not share your whole
address space to a device at all in a virtual machine manager, wouldn't you? And
if you can manage to have a separated mdev for your virtual machine, why bother
to set a PASID to it?  The answer to those problem, I think, will be Intel's
Scalable IO Virtualization. For accelerator, the requirement is simply: getting
a handle to device, attaching the process's mm with the handle by sharing the
process's page table with its iommu indexed by PASID, and start the
communication...

Say, I have 1024 queues in my accelerator. I can get one by opening the device
and attach it with the fd. If the process exit by any means, the queue can be
returned with the release of the fd. But if it is mdev, it will still be there
and some one should tell the allocator it is available again. This is not easy
to design in user space.
