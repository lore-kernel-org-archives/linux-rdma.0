If its crazy at driver level, I am sure it will be equally crazy for
any end-user too. Therefore no user would use those crazy resources
either.
Intent is certainly not for the individual drivers as we agreed in
past. IB stack maintainers would be reviewing new enum addition
anyway, whether its verb or hw resource (unlikely).

Sure. I will wait for his comments.

o.k. I will attempt. Looks doable.
I am on travel so it will take few more days for me to turn around
with below approach with tested code.
