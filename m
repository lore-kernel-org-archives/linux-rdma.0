I'm not a DPDK expert. But we had some discussion with LNG of Linaro. They were
considering to create something similar to simplify the user driver. In most of
case, we use DPDK or ODP (open data plane) just for faster data plane data flow.
But many logic such as setting the hardware mode, mac address and so on is not
necessary. So they were looking for a way to keep the driver in the kernel and
just the ring buffer of some queues to the user space. This may simplified the
user space design.

Woo. This will be helpful. Thank you very much.
