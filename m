Okay..

Well, if SENDs are not completing then it is not healthly. It is
analogous to what TCP Keep Alive does.

keep-alive is something different, it pings the remote periodicaly and
detects dead connections even when there is no traffic.

RDMA detects dead connections via retries and timeouts, but only if
there is traffic.

My questions was about how the same situation is handled in TCP. If it
does DMA directly from the source buffers by chaining them into SKBs
then it has exactly the same problem, it cannot release the buffers
until SKB is released from the TCP stack after NIC xmit. Like in RDMA,
this only happens once TCP has got the ack back.

Perhaps the answer is that TCP does not zero copy these buffers, or
TCP doesn't care about transmitting random memory, but it seems a
question worth asking.
