Hi Doug, Liran, Jason,

How would you like to see RDMA verb resources being defined - in RDMA
cgroup or in IB stack?
In current patch v5, its defined by the IB stack which is often
shipped as different package due to high amount of changes, bug fixes,
features.
In v0 patch it was defined by the RDMA cgroup, which means any new
resource addition/definition requires kernel upgrade. Which is hard to
change often.
If resources are defined by RDMA cgroup kernel than adding/removing
resource means, someone have to do lot of engineering with different
versions of kernel support and loadable module support using compat.h
etc at driver level, which in my mind is some amount of engineering
compare to what v5 has to offer and its already available. With one
round of cleanup in resource definition, it should be usable.

Its important to provide this feedback to Tejun and me, so that we
take informed design decision.

o.k. Its doable, but I believe its simple but its restrictive.
If rest of the RDMA experts are ok with it, I will change it to do it that way.
We get to hear their feedback before we put this as ABI.

We can set it to max. But during freeing time, checking array of 10+
elements whether its max or not, didn't find efficient either.

Most likely not. I tried to explained that in reply to Haggai's email
for RFC, also in rdma.txt documentation patch 3/3.
Let me try again.
Device stays in a system for long time. Mostly for months until
drivers are unloaded or firmware crashes or some other event.
While on other hand, cgroup life cycle is in hours or more.
So rpool that we allocated dynamically, it needs to be freed or
atleast when set to max or when cgroup is deleted.
But there is catch there, it cannot be freed because there are
processed which has allocated the resource from this cgroup, but have
been migrated to other cgroup which will uncharge sometime later.
(This is not a usecase, but its the artifact of cgroup interface).
So rpool needs to be freed at later when uncharge occurs. At that
point we drop the reference to the css, so that css can be freed and
same css->id can get circulated for new cgroup.
If we don't do this, and wait until device destruction, rpool just
keeps growing!
I think above is more important design aspect than just saving memory to me.

Let me know if you have different design thought here.
(Like engineering can_attach() callback in rdma_cgroup, which I don't
see necessary either).

Agree. Thats what the code is doing using marking object type being default.
If I remove the object type, as alternative,
It requires that when we uncharge resource, we should run through the
max array to see if they are all set to max.
And keep one aggregate counter for usage (apart from individual)
counter for each resource.

> How the object is created shouldn't be a factor.

Loop for max and aggregate counter can avoid creator variable.

o.k.

I tried to explain above about the need to free dynamically, instead
of device destruction time.

ok. Let me see how can I refactor this part of code. I will get back
on this if I hit a block.

Above explanation should justify that its problematic to keep that
around until device destruction.

I have tried to keep in simple. I respect your comments and have
improved upon most of the valuable comments that you gave in
subsequent patches from v0 to v5.
Few exceptions which I will work through now are:
1. resource definition place (cgroup vs IB stack) - avoid callback.
2. lock functions
3. dynamic freeing (which I think is justified now above).
