The list of resources are known at compile time.  Why is this separate
fixed number necessary?

There's no circular dependency issue here.  Include the appropriate
header.

Why does it need external op table?  The types of resources are gonna
be fixed at compile time.  The only thing necessary is each device
declaring which resources are to be used.

rdmacg_resource?  Also, wouldn't it be better to use u64?

Why the hell would creator need to be an atomic?  You're just using
set and read on the field.  What's going on?

Ugh... please refrain from single underscore prefixed names.  It's
best to give it a proper name.  e.g. if the function assumes lock is
grabbed by the user use _locked postfix and so on.

The config is tied to the device.  If the device goes away, all its
pools go away.  If the device stays, all configs stay.

That's one extremely silly way to write noop.

This function doesn't make any sense.  Push locking to the caller and
use find_cg_rpool().

Why does it need refcnting?  Things stay if the device is there.
Things go away if the device goes away.  No?  Can device go away while
resources are allocated?

Please just do

enum {
	RDMA_RES_VERB_A,
	RDMA_RES_VERB_B,
	...
	RDMA_RES_VERB_MAX,

	RDMA_RES_HW_BASE = RDMA_RES_VERB_MAX,
	RDMA_RES_HW_A = RDMA_RES_HW_BASE,
	RDMA_RES_HW_B,
	...
	RDMA_RES_HW_MAX,
};

static const char rdma_res_name[] = {
	[RDMA_RES_VERB_A]	= "...",
	...
};

And then let each device specify bitmap of resources that it supports
on registration.

You're grabbing the lock anyway.  Why bother with atomics at all?
Just grab the lock on entry, look up the entry and then do normal
integer ops.

The whole thing is still way more complex than it needs to be.  Please
slim it down.  It really shouldn't take half as much code.  Keep it
simple, please.

Thanks.
