Neither of those options actually.  I'm using hard,intr on the mount
flags, and by soft hang I mean that the application copying data
will come to a stop and never make any progress again.  When that
happens, you can usually interrupt the process and get back to the
command line, but it doesn't clean up internally in the kernel
because from that point on, attempts to unmount the nfs filesystem
return EBUSY.

OK, I'll see if I'm doing something wrong.  I can do nfs4 tcp mounts
just fine, but trying to do nfs4 rdma mounts results in operation not
permitted returns on the client.  And nfs3 mounts using rdma work as
expected.  This is all with the same server, same client, same mount
point, etc.

Probably.  I've been able to reproduce this for a while.  I originally
thought it was a problem between Mellanox <-> QLogic/Intel operation
because it reproduces faster in that environment, but I can get it to
reproduce in Mellanox <-> Mellanox situations too.

This sounds like what I'm seeing here too.

Haven't tried.  I'll queue that up for next week.
