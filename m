This approach appears to have been derived from the NFS/RDMA one.
The SMB protocol operates very differently! It is not a strict request/
response protocol. Many operations can become asynchronous by the
server choosing to make a STATUS_PENDING reply. A second reply then
comes later. The SMB2_CANCEL operation normally has no reply at all.
And callbacks for oplocks can occur at any time.

Even within a single request, many replies can be received. For example,
an SMB2_READ response which exceeds your negotiated receive size of
8192. These will be fragmented by SMB Direct into a "train" of multiple
messages, which will be logically reassembled by the receiver. Each of
them will consume a credit.

Thanks to SMB Direct crediting, the connection is not failing, but you are
undoubtedly spending a lot of time and ping-ponging to re-post receives
and allow the message trains to flow. And, because it's never one-to-one,
there are also unneeded receives posted before and after such exchanges.

You need to use SMB Direct crediting to post a more traffic-sensitive pool
of receives, and simply manage its depth when posting client requests.
As a start, I'd suggest simply choosing a constant number, approximately
whatever credit value you actually negotiate with the peer. Then, just
replenish (re-post) receive buffers as they are completed by the adapter.
You can get more sophisticated about this strategy later.
