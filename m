Yes, "user" -> "admin".
I think that percentage is more intuitive to them and will be much easier to
explain how to use it. I always have in mind "swappiness" field and the
numerous questions on how to configure it.

Yes, I had in mind something like IB_CGROUP_HCA, this is why it can be
done as a future work after accepting current patches.

Exactly.

This is exactly what I don't like, the percentage will remove from the
user the translation needs between weight and actual limitation.

IMHO CPU used weights because everything there is in weights :).

Why?
The device exposes max values during initialization and if user asked
for 20% percent of HCA, he will get max*0.2.
