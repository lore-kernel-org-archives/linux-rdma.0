ok. I will put comments in separate line.

o.k. I will align them.
o.k. I will document the resource constants defined by IB stack in
cgroup-v2.txt.

Yes. You did. I fixed at few places. I missed this out. Sorry. I am doing now.

Methods for both the constants are same. Code changes between two file
type is hardly 4 lines of code.
So there is no need of additional helper functions.
So in currently defined functions rdmacg_resource_read() and
rdmacg_resource_set_max() works on file type.

Above one seems to be aligned. Not sure what am I missing.
I am aligning all the structures anyways.

Aligning all the fields now in next patch.

Yes. Removed.

This is certainly must fix bug. Changed refcnt to usage_sum and changed to do
usage_sum -= num during uncharging
and
usage_sum += num during charing.

Single lock per subsystem? I understood that you were ok to have per
cgroup fine grain lock.

No. debugging was disabled. I will enable and run.
Help me little to understand,
Even if above function races with migration, do you mean cg can be
freed before css_get is executed?
If yes, than I guess I need subsystem level lock under which I need to
perform css_get()?
If not, whatever cg was returned, that should be ok as long as cg
reference is hold.
May be I am missing something here.

No. Its hot path. Typically applications do query configuration once
is their life cycle and allocate resources more often.

> I suppose there can only be a handful of devices per system?
Right. I have described that in the document as well. Typically there
are 1 to 4 devices in system and since the lock is per cgroup, though
this loop appears to be heavy on O complexity wise, its not that bad.
Hierarchical limit honoring is anyway default behavior we are adhering to.
