It can be a bug, and the behavior in this case is that the
client retransmits indefinitely and deadlocks the transport,
because the client's upper layer never sees a reply.

But as you know there are some NFS operations where the client
cannot predict in advance how large the reply will be. In
particular the upper bound size of an NFSACL GETACL reply or
certain NFSv4 GETATTR attributes are not predictable. These
I might categorize as protocol bugs.

A client can do its best by posting a very large reply buffer
for such operations, but since these situations typically
are in practice rare, but NFSv4 GETATTR can be a relatively
common operation, clients post a few dozen KB for the reply
buffer and call it a day.

In these cases (if they should ever fail IRL), returning an
error is polite and allows operation of other RPCs on that
transport to continue.
