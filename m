All recent proposals of the new ABI schema deals with extending the 
flexibility of the current schema by letting drivers define their 
specific types, actions, attributes, etc. Even more than that, the 
dispatching starts from the driver and it chooses if it wants to use the 
common RDMA core layer or have it's own wise implementation instead.
Some drivers might even prefer not to implement the current verbs types.
These decisions were made in the OFVWG meetings.

Anyway, maybe we should consider using a more higher-level logic objects 
that could fit multiple drivers requirements.

Sounds reasonable, but what about drivers which ignore the common code 
and implement it in their own way? What about drivers which don't 
support the standard RDMA types at all?
I guess we should find a balance between something abstract and common 
enough that will ease administrator configuration but be specific enough 
for the various models we have (or will have) in the RDMA stack.

Of course, but since the ABI and cgroups model are somehow related, they 
should be dealt with together and approved by Doug who participated in 
some of the OFVWG meetings.

So a driver will change the cgroups file for every new type it adds?
Will we just have a super set enum of all crazy types vendors added?

Since this affect the user, it's better to think how it fits our 
"optional standard"/"vendor types" model first. Maybe we could force all 
standard types even if the driver we use doesn't support any of them.

Clearly we should differ adding the actual code until a driver could 
declare such objects, but we need to decide how to expose the standard 
optional RDMA types (basically, the types you've added) and how future 
driver specific types fit in.

One proposal is [1]. There's another one from Sean which aims for 
similar targets regards the driver specific types.
