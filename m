OK, will do. I find it hard to understand what the ABI implications
are. I'll post the next version without untagging in brk, mmap,
munmap, mremap (for new_address), mmap_pgoff, remap_file_pages, shmat
and shmdt.

OK. Should I store a flag somewhere in task_struct? Should it be
inheritable on clone?

OK.
