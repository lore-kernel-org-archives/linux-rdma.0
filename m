Let me try again to take weights example.

total resources distributed is based on equation:

resource_of_cg = weight_of_cg * max_resource_of_hca / (sum of all weights)

say there is only one cg-A. Lets say it has weight of 20.
max_resource_of_hca = 100.

So total resource_for_cg_A = (20 * 100) / 20 = 100 (all resources).

Now new cg-B is created with weight of 20.
So with new cg-B, cg-A and cg-B will get 50 resources.

With cg-C creation with weight of 20, each cg gets 33 resources.

Which means that resources are recalculated dynamically on
running/creating new cgroups.

Why don't we have such requirements on the actual dataplane and
control plane APIs side (similar to having abstract socket APIs).
Instead we expect applications to change to make use of new verbs
objects for performance, functionality etc.

New future objects can be limited if we introduce weights/percentage
knob but at the cost of not able to tune for performance.
Usually end-users will use application templates when they deploy for
specific applications, such as mongodb, MPI cluster, glusterFS cluster
etc.
So those application specific plug-in would program exact ratio of MR
to QP or PD to QP etc by writing values to rdma.max depending on MPI
rank, cluster size etc.

weights API allow to auto adjust the value for existing cgroups when
new cgroups are added/removed when deployed application is not well
defined.
