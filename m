Hi Tejun,

(Sending again as by mistake previous mail was non plain text, sorry
about that).

So based on your comments, Haggai's comments below and past
experience, I will spin v6.o
I have made changes, and testing them. I am likely to post during
coming long weekend.

I have simplified many pieces.
Can you please confirm below design/implementation looks ok to you?
If you want to review v6 directly, I am fine with that too instead of
below post.

1. Removed two type of resource pool, made is single type (as you
described in past comment)
2. Removed match tokens and have array definition like "qp", "mr", "cq" etc.
3. Wrote small parser and avoided match_token API as that won't work
due to different array definition
4. Removed one-off remove API to unconfigure cgroup, instead all
resource should be set to max.
5. Removed resource pool type (user/default), instead having max_num_cnt,
when ref_cnt drops to zero and max_num_cnt = total_rescource_cnt, pool is freed.
6. Resource definition ownership is now only with IB stack at single
header file, no longer in each low level driver.
This goes through IB maintainer and other reviewers eyes.
This continue to give flexibility to not force kernel upgrade for few
enums additions for new resource type.
7. Wherever possible pool lock is pushed out, except for hierarchical
charging/unchanging points, as it not possible to do so, due to
iterative process involves blocking allocations of rpool. Coming up
more levels up to release locks doesn't make any sense either.
This is anyway slow path where rpool is not allocated. Except for
typical first resource allocation, this is less traveled path.
8.Other minor cleanups.
9. Avoided %d manipulation due to removal of match_token and replaced
with seq_putc etc friend functions.
