Well, it's a different problem since as I said the port collision
problem is a non-issue for iSCSI anyway.  But yes having a separate
interface to assign an iWARP IP address to an RNIC does seem to avoid
the immediate problem.

I actually don't know what the right answer is -- having a separate IP
address for iWARP does seem to lead to having to duplicate everything
for configuring it.  (And this is the approach for the cxgb[34] iSCSI
drivers, right?)

On the other hand trying to hook offloaded iWARP into the normal stack
does seem to lead to a mess.  I see DaveM's point: TCP port space is
just the beginning -- filtering, queueing, etc also have config that
ultimately an offload device would want to hook too.

Maybe the sanest out of a bad set of options would be to come up with a
standard way to configure independent TCP/IP stacks that share a link.

really, dunno.
