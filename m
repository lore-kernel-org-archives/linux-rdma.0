Sure, I setup AIO with O_DIRECT and launch a read.

Then I fork and dirty the READ target memory using the CPU in the
child.

As you described in this case the fork will retain the physical page
that is undergoing O_DIRECT DMA, and the parent gets a new copy'd page.

The DMA completes, and the child gets the DMA'd to page. The parent
gets an unchanged copy'd page.

The parent gets the AIO completion, but can't see the data.

I'd call that a bug with O_DIRECT. The only correct outcome is that
the parent will always see the O_DIRECT data. Fork should not cause
the *parent* to malfunction. I agree the child cannot make any
prediction what memory it will see.

I assume the same flow is possible using threads and read()..

It is really no different than the RDMA bug with fork.
