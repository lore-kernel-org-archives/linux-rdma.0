Because the VM manager (such as qemu) do not want to share its whole space to
the device. It is a security problem.

This is not the way that you can use mdev. To use mdev, you have to:

1. unbind kernel driver from the device, and rebind it to vfio driver
2. for 0 to 1204: uuid > /sys/.../the_dev/mdev/create to create all the mdev
3. a virtual iommu_group will be created in /dev/vfio/* from every mdev

now you can do this in you application (even without considering the pasid) :

	container = open(/dev/vfio);
	ioctl(container, settting);
	group = open(/dev/vfio/my_group_for_particular_mdev);
	ioctl(container, attach_group, group);
	device = ioctl(group, get_device);
	mmap(device);
	ioctl(container, set_dma_operation);

Then you have to make a decision, how can you find a available mdev for use and
how to return it.

We have considered creating only one mdev and allocating queue when the device
is openned. But the VFIO maintainer, Alex, did not agree and said it broke the
VFIO origin idea.
