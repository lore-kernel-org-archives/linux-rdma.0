+1. Overview
+
+1-1. What is RDMA resource controller?
+-------------------------------------
+
+RDMA resource controller allows user to limit RDMA/IB specific resourc=
es
+that a given set of processes can use. These processes are grouped usi=
ng
+RDMA resource controller.
+
+RDMA resource controller currently allows two different type of resour=
ce
+pools.
+(a) RDMA IB specification level verb resources defined by IB stack
+(b) HCA vendor device specific resources
+
+RDMA resource controller controller allows maximum of upto 64 resource=
s in
+a resource pool which is the internal construct of rdma cgroup explain=
ed
+at later part of this document.
+
+1-2. Why RDMA resource controller needed?
+----------------------------------------
+
+Currently user space applications can easily take away all the rdma de=
vice
+specific resources such as AH, CQ, QP, MR etc. Due to which other appl=
ications
+in other cgroup or kernel space ULPs may not even get chance to alloca=
te any
+rdma resources. This leads to service unavailability.
+
+Therefore RDMA resource controller is needed through which resource co=
nsumption
+of processes can be limited. Through this controller various different=
 rdma
+resources described by IB uverbs layer and any HCA vendor driver can b=
e
+accounted.
+
+1-3. How is RDMA resource controller implemented?
+------------------------------------------------
+
+rdma cgroup allows limit configuration of resources. These resources a=
re not
+defined by the rdma controller. Instead they are defined by the IB sta=
ck
+and HCA device drivers(optionally).
+This provides great flexibility to allow IB stack to define new resour=
ces,
+without any changes to rdma cgroup.
+Rdma cgroup maintains resource accounting per cgroup, per device, per =
resource
+type using resource pool structure. Each such resource pool is limited=
 up to
+64 resources in given resource pool by rdma cgroup, which can be exten=
ded
+later if required.
+
+This resource pool object is linked to the cgroup css. Typically there
+are 0 to 4 resource pool instances per cgroup, per device in most use =
cases.
+But nothing limits to have it more. At present hundreds of RDMA device=
s per
+single cgroup may not be handled optimally, however there is no known =
use case
+for such configuration either.
+
+Since RDMA resources can be allocated from any process and can be free=
d by any
+of the child processes which shares the address space, rdma resources =
are
+always owned by the creator cgroup css. This allows process migration =
from one
+to other cgroup without major complexity of transferring resource owne=
rship;
+because such ownership is not really present due to shared nature of
+rdma resources. Linking resources around css also ensures that cgroups=
 can be
+deleted after processes migrated. This allow progress migration as wel=
l with
+active resources, even though that=E2=80=99s not the primary use case.
+
+Finally mapping of the resource owner pid to cgroup is maintained usin=
g
+simple hash table to perform quick look-up during resource charing/unc=
harging
+time.
+
+Resource pool object is created in following situations.
+(a) User sets the limit and no previous resource pool exist for the de=
vice
+of interest for the cgroup.
+(b) No resource limits were configured, but IB/RDMA stack tries to
+charge the resource. So that it correctly uncharge them when applicati=
ons are
+running without limits and later on when limits are enforced during un=
charging,
+otherwise usage count will drop to negative. This is done using defaul=
t
+resource pool. Instead of implementing any sort of time markers, defau=
lt pool
+simplifies the design.
+
+Resource pool is destroyed if it was of default type (not created
+by administrative operation) and it=E2=80=99s the last resource gettin=
g
+deallocated. Resource pool created as administrative operation is not
+deleted, as it=E2=80=99s expected to be used in near future.
+
+If user setting tries to delete all the resource limit
+with active resources per device, RDMA cgroup just marks the pool as
+default pool with maximum limits for each resource, otherwise it delet=
es the
+default resource pool.
+
+2. Usage Examples
+-----------------
+
+(a) List available RDMA verb level resources:
+
+#cat /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/1/rdma.resource.verb.list
+Output:
+mlx4_0 uctx ah pd mr srq qp flow
+
+(b) Configure resource limit:
+echo mlx4_0 mr=3D100 qp=3D10 ah=3D2 > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/1/rdma.resou=
rce.verb.limit
+echo ocrdma1 mr=3D120 qp=3D20 cq=3D10 > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.res=
ource.verb.limit
+
+(c) Query resource limit:
+cat /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.resource.verb.limit
+#Output:
+mlx4_0 mr=3D100 qp=3D10 ah=3D2
+ocrdma1 mr=3D120 qp=3D20 cq=3D10
+
+(d) Query current usage:
+cat /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.resource.verb.usage
+#Output:
+mlx4_0 mr=3D95 qp=3D8 ah=3D2
+ocrdma1 mr=3D0 qp=3D20 cq=3D10
+
+(e) Delete resource limit:
+echo mlx4_0 remove > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/1/rdma.resource.verb.limit
+
+(f) List available HCA HW specific resources: (optional)
+cat /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/1/rdma.hw.verb.list
+vendor1 hw_qp hw_cq hw_timer
+
+(g) Configure hw specific resource limit:
+echo vendor1 hw_qp=3D56 > /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma/2/rdma.resource.hw.limit
