It is handled in kernel/fork.c look for DONTCOPY, basicaly it just
leave empty page table in the child process so child will have to
fault in new page. This also means that child will get 0 as initial
value for all memory address under DONTCOPY/DONTFORK which breaks
application expectation of what fork() do.

No it is not, O_DIRECT is fine. The only corner case i can think
of with O_DIRECT is one thread launching an O_DIRECT that write
to private anonymous memory (other O_DIRECT case do not matter)
while another thread call fork() then what the child get can be
undefined ie either it get the data before the O_DIRECT finish
or it gets the result of the O_DIRECT. But this is realy what
you should expect when doing such thing without synchronization.

So O_DIRECT is fine.

Fixing that would incur a high cost: need to grow struct page, need
to copy potentialy gigabyte of memory during fork() ... this would be
a serious performance regression for many folks just to work around an
abuse of device driver. So i don't think anything on that front would
be welcome.

umem without proper ODP and VFIO are the only bad user i know of (for
VFIO you can argue that it is part of the API contract and thus that
it is not an abuse but it is not spell out loud in documentation). I
have been trying to push back on any people trying to push thing that
would make the same mistake or at least making sure they understand
what is happening.

What really need to happen is people fixing their hardware and do the
right thing (good software engineer versus evil hardware engineer ;))
