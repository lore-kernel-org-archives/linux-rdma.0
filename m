Two things come to mind - PD's, and virtualization.

If there's no ib_get_dma_mr() call, what PD does the region get?
One could argue it inherits the QP's (Emulex proposed such a
PD-less MR in this year's OFS Developer's Workshop). But this
could impose new conditions on ULP's; they would have to be
aware of this affinity and it could affect their QP use.

More importantly, if a guest can post FRWR work requests with
physical addresses, what enforces their validity? The dma_mr
provides a PD but it also allows the host partition to interpose
on the call, setting up an IOMMU mapping, creating a new NIC TPT
mapping, etc. Without this, it may be possible for hostile guest
to forge FRMR's and attack the host, or other guests.

This is a subtle area. If the driver posts silenced completions as
you describe, there may not be a wc to reap. So either the driver or
the ULP will need to post a sentinel, the completion of which indicates
any prior silenced operations have actually done so. This can be
hard to get right. And if the driver posts everything signaled, well,
performance at high IOPS will be a challenge. The ULP is much better
positioned to manage that.

I'm with you on the flow control, btw. It's a new rule for the
ULP to obey, but probably not too onerous. Remember though, verbs
today return EAGAIN when the queue you're posting is full (a
terrible choice IMO). So upper layers don't actually need to
count WR's, unless they want to.

Tom.
