Hi Doug,

I am still waiting for Leon to provide his comments if any on rdma cgroup.
>From other email context, he was on vacation last week.
While we wait for his comments, I wanted to know your view of this
patchset in 4.9 merge window.

To summarize the discussion that happened in two threads.

[1] Ack by Tejun, asking for review from rdma list
[2] quick review by Christoph on patch-v11 (patch 12 has only typo corrections)
[3] Christoph's ack on architecture of rdma cgroup and fitting it with ABI
[4] My response on Matan's query on RSS indirection table
[5] Response from Intel on their driver support for Matan's query
[6] Christoph's point on architecture, which we are following in new
ABI and current ABI

I have reviewed recent patch [7] from Matan where I see IB verbs
objects are still handled through common path as suggested by
Christoph.

I do not see any issues with rdma cgroup patchset other than it requires rebase.
Am I missing something?
Can you please help me - What would be required to merge it to 4.9?
