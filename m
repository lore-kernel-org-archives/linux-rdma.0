The convention is established in

 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-nfsv4-rpcrdma-bidirection/

Specifically, it states that backward direction messages in
RPC-over-RDMA Version One cannot have chunks and cannot be
larger than the connection's inline threshold. Thus these
checks are all valid and will not reject valid forward or
backward messages.

The reason for that stipulation is it makes the RPC-over-RDMA
header in backward direction messages a fixed size.

a. The call direction field in incoming RPC headers is then
   always at a predictable offset in backward direction calls.
   This means chunk lists don't have to be parsed to find the
   call direction field. All that is needed is to ensure that
   the chunk lists in the header are empty before going after
   the call direction field. If any chunk list is present, it
   must be a forward direction message.

b. The maximum size of backward direction messages is
   predictable: it is always the inline threshold minus the
   size of the RPC-over-RDMA header (always 28 bytes when
   there are no chunks).

The client side has a very similar looking set of checks in
its reply handler to distinguish incoming backward direction
RPC calls from forward direction RPC replies.

The XDR definition of RPC-over-RDMA in Section 4.3 of
RFC 5666 defines the on-the-wire credits field as a 
uint32.

I prefer that the host representation of this
field match the sign and be able to contain the full
range values that can be conveyed in the on-the-wire
field. That makes marshaling and unmarshaling of the
wire value straightforward; and reasoning about the
C code in our implementation also applies directly to
wire values as well.

The forward channel max_requests field on the client,
rb_max_requests, is also a u32 since commit 9b1dcbc8cf46
from February 2015.

I've changed the equivalent server side field,
sc_max_requests, to a u32 in the next version of this
series.

ib_device_attr::max_qp_wr and svcxprt_rdma::sc_sq_depth
are both signed, but I can't imagine what a negative
value in these fields could mean.

sc_sq_depth is plugged into ib_qp_cap::max_send_wr and
ib_cq_init_attr::cqe, which are both unsigned, so
sc_sq_depth really should be unsigned too, IMHO.
