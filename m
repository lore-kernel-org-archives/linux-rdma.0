Wasn't this the model that we agreed upon?  Besides, even if the
resources are to be supplied by the driver, a better way would be
letting it specify the tables of resources.  There's no reason for
indirection through a callback.

So, what we discussed before just went out the window?

Keep the resource types in an array in minimal way and match with the
information from core side.  It doesn't make any sense to use match
tokens in defining resources when the resource type is always fixed.

I still don't get it.  Why isn't this tied to the lifetime of the
device?

You're re-stating the same thing without explaining the reasoning
behind it.  Why is this different from other controllers?  What's the
justification?

Yeah, create on demand all you want but why is the end of lifetime
tied to who created?

No, the locking scheme doesn't make any sense.  Except for some
special cases, sequence like the following indicates that the code is
buggy or at least silly.

	lock;
	obj = find_refcnted_obj();
	unlock;
	return obj;

In this particular case, just push out locking to the users.

Just create on demand and keep it around till the device is
unregistered.

IIRC, I clearly objected to delegating resource definition to
individual drivers.

As it currently stands,
