The main purpose of this series is to address connection drop
recovery issues by fixing FRMR re-use to make it less likely the
client will deadlock due to a memory management operation error.
Some clean-ups and other fixes are present as well.

See topic branch nfs-rdma-for-3.17-plan-b in

git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/cel/cel-2.6.git

Topic branch nfs-rdma-for-3.17 still contains v4 of this series.
You can choose whichever series is convenient for you and Roland.

I tested with NFSv3 and NFSv4 on all three supported memory
registration modes. Used cthon04, iozone, vdbench, and dbench with
both Solaris and Linux NFS/RDMA servers. Used xfstests with Linux.


v5:

- Rebased on v3.16-rc7

- Replaced patch 08/21 with an equivalent one-liner that does not
  alter include/rdma/ib_verbs.h. A couple of subsequent patches were
  updated to apply on the new 08/21. This allows the whole series to
  be submitted through the NFS tree.


v4:

- Rebased on v3.16-rc6

- Add Tested-by: from Shirley Ma and Devesh Sharma


v3:
Only two substantive changes:

- Patch 08/21 now uses generic IB helpers for managing FRMR
  rkeys

- Add Tested-by: from Steve Wise


v2:
Many patches from v1 have been written or replaced.

The MW ref counting approach in v1 is abandoned. Instead, I've
eliminated signaling FAST_REG_MR and LOCAL_INV, and added
appropriate recovery mechanisms after a transport reconnect that
should prevent rkey dis-synchrony entirely.

A couple of optimizations have been added, including:

- Allocating each MW separately rather than carving each out of a
  large piece of contiguous memory

- Now that the receive CQ upcall handler dequeues a bundle of CQEs
  at once, fire off the reply handler tasklet just once per upcall
  to reduce context switches and how often hard IRQs are disabled
