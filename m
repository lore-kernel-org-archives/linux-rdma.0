In other cgroup such as CPU, this is done using cpu.weight API. Where
percentage or weight is configured by the user.
In this mode, resources taken away from other cgroup proportionately.
It works for cpu because its mainly stateless resource unlike rdma
resources.
So if we want to simplify user configuration similarly,
percentage/weight configuration can be extended.
This way they need not be introduced to users.
I hope your definition of "user" is actual end-user and not rdma cgroup. Right?
In other words, new object should be still added as new enum value in
rdma_cgroup.h?
Only than it can be overwritten by specific UVERBs type as you
described below. I think thats what you meant as you described below.

Otherwise charging/uncharging this new percentage resource can get messy.

So to refine your proposal from cgroup perspective, instead of adding
new resource type in rdma_cgroup.h for percentage, I prefer to have

Existing
1. rdma.max
2. rdma.current
New,
3. rdma.weight
This ABI will have similar API to say
echo "mlx4_0 50" > rdma.weight.
Where 50 is weight of the resources.
For example,
for one cgroup instance weight=sum=100% resource for a given cgroup.
for three cgroup instances percentage=(weight/sum)% = 50/(50+50+50) = 33%.
One cgroup gets 33% resource.

Weight can be in range of 1 to 10,000 similar to cpu cgroup.

This might work if applications running in all cgroups are similar.
But weight doesn't do justice, when there are different type of
applications running in each cgroup. Such as few running libfabric
based apps, few running MPI, others directly using ibverbs.
So as you said rdma.max configuration would be required for management
plane to override weight (percentage) for certain resources.
