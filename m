Hi,

Sorry for the late reply.

I think that starting with the standard set of resources that uverbs 
provide is good, and if we need in the future new types of resources 
we can add them later.

There is indeed an effort to backport the latest RDMA subsystem modules to 
older kernels, and it would be preferable to be able to introduce new
resources through these modules. However, I understand that there are no
other cgroups that are modules or depend on modules this way, so I would
understand if you decide against it.

If I understand correctly, if the resources are defined in the cgroup,
you simply won't be able to add new resources with a module update,
no matter how hard you work.

I agree that if the cgroup code is changed for cleanup or whatever 
reason, the backporting may become difficult, but that's just life.

Sure. I hope this patchset gets accepted eventually, as I believe it 
solves a real problem. Today RDMA application can easily hog these 
resources and the rdma cgroup allows users to prevent that.
