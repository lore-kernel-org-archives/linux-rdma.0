Hi,

(adding linux-api@ for comments:

 We're introducing a new "uverb" in the InfiniBand subsystem:
 extended QUERY_DEVICE in v3.19:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?=
id=3D860f10a799c8

 As you may not already know, InfiniBand subsystem use a write()=20
 syscall[1] to issue ioctl()-like operations. Many operations (aka  =20
 verbs) are available [2], for each there's a query data structures
 and for some there's a response data structure [3]. As a result to a=20
 write() operation, kernel could allocate resources on the task behalf=20
 and/or write data back to userspace provided buffers whose pointers=20
 were part of buffer passed to write().

 I've expressed concern on the way the new extended QUERY_DEVICE
 was trying to be itself expandable: by silently ignoring shorter
 buffer, returning truncated data, the interface seems awkward.

 I recognize the author's intention to provide a way for userspace
 to retrieve easily the highest supported information as something
 desirable.

 But I believe we must be more strict on the request content and
 fail for any unrecognized, unsupported, incorrect bits to make
 safer to extend the interface latter.

 I've submitted a patchset[4] to address these issues.
 But, while I'm convinced it the way to go, I'm not able to find
 how it could be made to satisfy the original author expectations.

 I hope linux-api@ readers could provide some insight regarding
 the way we should implement such interface

O(log2(N))

Or you had to add a different interface, dedicated to retrieve the exac=

supported feature mask.

With regard to QUERY_DEVICE: the data structure layout depends on the
comp_mask value. So either you propose a way to express multipart data
structure (see CMSG or NETLINK), or we have to ensure the data structur=
e
is ever-growing, with each new chunck stacked over the existing ones:
that's the purpose of :

	if (cmd.comp_mask & (cmd.comp_mask + 1))
		return -EINVAL;

That's what I've already explained earlier in "Re: [PATCH v3 06/17]
IB/core: Add support for extended query device caps":

http://mid.gmane.org/1421844612.13543.40.camel-RlY5vtjFyJ3QT0dZR+AlfA@public.gmane.org

The extended QUERY_DEVICE uverbs as currently merged is using comp_mask
from input to choose to report on-demand-paging related value. So it
seems it's needed.

That's already the case for on demand paging.

If we keep the checks on output buffer size from patch 1, returning
-ENOSPC in case of size mismatch, and if we are sure that no bit in
input comp_mask will ever trigger a call to a kernel function that can
make the uverb fail, the latter check on known value could be dropped,
allowing the userspace to set the highest mask (-1): userspace
will use -ENOSPC to probe the expected size of the response buffer
to match the highest supported comp_mask. But it's going to hurt
userspace application not ready to receive -ENOSPC on newer kernel
with extended QUERY_DEVICE ABI ... Oops.

So in this end, the safest way to ensure userspace is doing the correct
thing so that we have backward and forward compatibility is to check
for known values in comp_mask, check for response buffer size and ensur=
e
that data structure chunk are stacked.

The tighter are the checks now, the easier the interface could be
extended latter.
