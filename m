I agree with Tejun that this proposal is at the wrong level of abstraction.

If you look at just trying to limit QPs, it's not clear what that attempts to accomplish.  Conceptually, a QP is little more than an addressable endpoint.  It may or may not map to HW resources (for Intel NICs it does not).  Even when HW resources do back the QP, the hardware is limited by how many QPs can realistically be active at any one time, based on how much caching is available in the NIC.

Trying to limit the number of QPs that an app can allocate, therefore, just limits how much of the address space an app can use.  There's no clear link between QP limits and HW resource limits, unless you assume a very specific underlying implementation.
