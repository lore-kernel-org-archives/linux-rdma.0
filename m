That depends on the OS.

Red Hat requires that you enable NFSoRDMA.  But, your point is valid.
That goes back to my point about the update patch set being very verbose
about the dangers of this.  The very obvious kernel message is helpful
in this case.

Yes.  This is an antiquated security model.  There is a reason for that.
 It is easier to go simple to begin with and then add the extra layers
needed to keep things safe once you have the basics right.

iWARP requires a normal TCP socket to connect to, then the client must
initiate an RDMA transfer, then a new connection is opened for the RDMA
transfers.  Blocking the parent dst:port/*:* will prevent these
connections.  If you are referring to allowing an untrusted client in
TCP mode but blocking them in RDMA mode, that's more complex and
requires app/ULP support.

See above, an unexpected vulnerability caused by this model should
result in a very obvious kernel message.

Black hat server is beyond the scope of this discussion.
