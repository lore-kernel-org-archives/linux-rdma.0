We'll obviously need different strutures for the libibvers API
and the kernel interface in this case, and we'll need to figure out
how to properly translate them.  I think a cast, plus compile time
type checking ala BUILD_BUG_ON is the way to go.

That would break the users of the interface.  However automatically
generating the user ABI from the kernel one might still be a good idea
in the long run.
