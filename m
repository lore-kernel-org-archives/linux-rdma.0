Haven't we already solve this for the pNFS file driver that XFS
implements? i.e. these export operations:

        int (*get_uuid)(struct super_block *sb, u8 *buf, u32 *len, u64 *offset);
        int (*map_blocks)(struct inode *inode, loff_t offset,
                          u64 len, struct iomap *iomap,
                          bool write, u32 *device_generation);
        int (*commit_blocks)(struct inode *inode, struct iomap *iomaps,
                             int nr_iomaps, struct iattr *iattr);

so mapping/allocation of file offset to sector mappings, which can
then trivially be used to grab the memory address through the bdev
->direct_access method, yes?

Cheers,

Dave.
