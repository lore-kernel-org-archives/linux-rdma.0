o.k. If some drivers doesn't implement current verbs type, there is no
point in controlling it either.
In such case application space library won't even invoke resource
allocation/free for unsupported resources.
For resources (type in your word) which are not defined in cgroup, but
exist in hw driver, cannot be controlled by cgroup.
As you highlighted in your [1], "driver's specific attributes could
someday become core's standard attributes", we should be able to add
new resource type to existing rdma cgroup.

I do not have any other objects other than QP, MR etc in mind currently.
I can think of a RDMA specific socket that encompass one PD, AH,
couple of MRs, and QP.
But we don't have such resource abstraction and its data transport
APIs in place.
There is rsocket, various versions of MPI, libfabric etc in place.
So I am not sure which high level objects to defined at this point.
If you have such objects nailed down, we should be able to add them in
incremental development.

Shouldn't Doug ask them to use cgroup infrastructure instead of
implementing resource charging/uncharing in their own way.
It still unlikely or difficult for drivers to group processes them
selves like cgroup to implement things in their own way.
I agree, they can completely ignore RDMA verbs resources and implement
their own HW resources.

As you pointed below, we need to find balance between which hw
resource to be defined and which not.
For example, newly added XRQ object, which could be a pure buffer_tag
with receive queue for other vendor. I am not sure how to abstract
them into single object.

Sure.

Well, we wanted to avoid that such churn in cgroup file, thats why v11
was defining resources in IB core. But I guess that was not
acceptable. I had NAK from Christoph and Tejun on that idea.

> Will we just have a super set enum of all crazy types vendors added?
As you said, we need to find balance. I frankly don't know how to do
so. There has to be some reasonable number of types. As we go along
Doug, Tejun and others should approve adding such.
If I am not wrong in past one year, may be two more resource types got
added? XRQ, state-less Queues?

If vendor doesn't support a given type, user won't allocate it. So its
just don't care condition.
I dont see a need to force standard types either.

o.k. Few more handful of driver specific types should be ok to add in cgroup.
I will let others speak up if thats not acceptable. Current code
already documents and provide infrastructure for that.

I looked at the RFC briefly. I can see that old infrastructure (a) and
(b) is not going away.
So It should be ok. to charge/uncharge those standard resources from
those hooks.
