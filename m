Hi Anna-

Keeping related fields together is usually more important than an extra
line or two in a commit. At the very least, the function of these fields
is more clear (to me, anyway) in this order.

Generally it's good practice to keep together structure fields that are
used at the same time. These four fields might appear in the same CPU
cacheline, though that can change as fields are introduced or removed
earlier in struct rpc_rqst.

An argument can be made that the code is just as easy to read this way:

        void                    *rq_buffer, *rq_rbuffer;
        size_t                  rq_callsize, rq_rcvsize;

If that's your preference as maintainer, I will change it in the next
version of this series.
