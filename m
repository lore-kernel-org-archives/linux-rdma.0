To my knowledge Intel HFI driver is the only one.

Instead of in rdma controller, its hard coded in IB stack.
I see this as an advantage where resource definition ownership remains
with IB stack maintainers, rather than rdma cgroup maintainer.
rdma cgroup maintainer doesn't have to understand what SRQ vs QP or
ODP type MR or multicast group is.
IB stack maintainer is better placed to judge and define it.

I would like to hear from Jason, Doug, Liran and other RDMA experts
about their thoughts.

I think this checks for new resource type can be ensured by IB stack
maintainer to avoid the mess.

My preference is IB stack to define resource, but I am ok to let go
this feature if consensus is RDMA cgroup.
