Hi Christoph,

Reopening thread for discussion so that I can proceed to generate next patch.

Recap:
rdma cgroup controller in the patch defines the framework so that RDMA
subsystem can define the resources.
This is similar to at least two functionality provided by core kernel.

(a) Block elevator defining framework and provides way to loadable
kernel modules to define actual IO scheduler (out of the 3 or 4) that
can be plugged-in since last many years.
(b) VFS core defining framework for external loadable modules to load
file system.

None of these core kernel functionality actually filter based on enum
or names - which IO scheduler(s), file system(s) are
allowed/disallowed.
rdma cgroup controller and rdma subsystem follows similar design approach.

Therefore can I go ahead with current approach?

Tejun also mentioned that he likes to see rdma resources to be defined
by rdma cgroup rather than rdma subsystem in below thread primarily to
reduce the complexity.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/4/507

However submitted patch is fairly small for defining resource in rdma
subsystem (instead of kernel).
This also allows to provide fixes and features done in rdma subsystem
in field at much faster pace and avoids complexity around back-porting
on various OS and their kernel flavors.
Please let me know your views.

Regards,
Parav Pandit
