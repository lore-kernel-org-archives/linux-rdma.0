Hi Doug,

Leon has finished review as well in [7].
Christoph Acked too in [8].

Can you please advise whether
(1) I should rebase and resend PatchV12?
(2) If so for which branch - master/4.9 or?

Tejun and Christoph mentioned that it might be late for 4.9.
Can we atleast merge to linux-rdma tree, so that more features/changes
can be done on top of it?

How can we avoid merge conflict to Linus since this patchset is
applicable to two git trees. (cgroup and linux-rdma).
I was thinking to push through linux-rdma as it is currently going
through more changes, so resolving merge conflict would be simpler if
that happens.

Please provide the direction.
