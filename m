Resources exposed by the cgroup are basically a UAPI, so we have to be
careful to make it stable when it evolves. I understand the need for
vendor specific resources, following the discussion on the previous
proposal, but could you write on how you plan to allow these set of
resources to evolve?

In what way does the design depend on this assumption?

Having a default resource pool kind of implies there is a non-default
one. Is the only difference between the default and non-default the fact
that the second was created with an administrative operation and has
specified limits or is there some other difference?

It sounds a little different from how other cgroups behave. I agree that
mostly processes will create the resources in their cgroup and won't
migrate, but why not move the charge during migration?

I finally wanted to ask about other limitations an RDMA cgroup could
handle. It would be great to be able to limit a container to be allowed
to use only a subset of the MAC/VLAN pairs programmed to a device, or
only a subset of P_Keys and GIDs it has. Do you see such limitations
also as part of this cgroup?

Thanks,
