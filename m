Actually you're right - the NFS server never tears down the MR. So, the
old code is just as vulnerable as the new code.

The rkeys have a PD, wich cannot be forged, so it's not a matter of
attacking, but it is most definitely a system integrity risk, as I
mentioned earlier, a simple arithmetic offset mistake can overwrite
anything.

s/security/integrity/ and I agree.

Yes, Doug, shamefully it did, but

a) That was the client and Jason and I are talking about the server
b) When that code was written (2007), FRMR did not exist, and other
    memory registration methods had abysmal performance
c) It was heavily deprecated with console warnings emitted
d) Chuck did away with it since then.

I'll say something after requoting you.

All excellent points. It's not worse, and it adds important transport
support.

However, it's an extremely bad idea to codify writable privileged rmr's
in the API as best practice. So under no circumstance should that become
the long term plan.
