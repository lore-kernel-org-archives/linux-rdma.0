Not every low level driver. I started with that infrastructure in
v2,v3 but I got your inputs and
I align with that. It could be just single IB stack in one header file
in one enum list would be sufficient.
You have already given that example.
With that mostly two resource type that I have can also shrink to just
single type.
Will wait to hear from them, in case if they have any different thought.

ok. setting all values to max is not really a common use case. So I
believe its ok to do that and therefore remove "remove" option.

Yes. Thats what is done in current patch. css_get on charge and
css_put on uncharge, that takes care nicely to free the rpool.

ok. Let me attempt that.

I will wait for day or two before I roll out v6 to get any feedback if
Liran, Haggai or Doug has any comments on definition part for resource
type.
