You are using NIC terminology, in the documentation, you wrote that it is n=
eeded
for DPDK use and I don't really understand, why do we need another shiny new
interface for DPDK.

It is not very accurate. We have RXE driver which is virtual RDMA device
which is implemented purely in SW. It struggles from bad performance and
sporadic failures, but it is enough to try RDMA on your laptop in VM.
