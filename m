Aren't you assuming a specific hardware design/implementation?  For cxgb4, the fact that a work request was consumed by the HW from the host send queue in no way indicates it is complete.  Also, the RDMA specs specifically state that the rnic/hca implementation can only assume an unsignaled work request completes successfully (and make its slot in the SQ available for the ULP) when a subsequent signaled work request completes successfully.   So if the next signaled work request fails, I believe the completion status of prior unsignaled work requests is indeterminate.
