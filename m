So, if that's the case, let's please implement something higher level.
The goal is providing reasonable isolation or protection.  If that can
be achieved at a higher level of abstraction, please do that.

Well, the programming interface that userland builds on top doesn't
matter too much here but if there is a common resource abstraction
which can be made in terms of constructs that consumers of the
facility would care about, that likely is a better choice than
exposing whatever hardware exposes.

Again, I was talking more about resource abstraction - e.g. something
along the line of "I want N command buffers".

I don't know.  What's proposed in this thread seems way too low level
to be useful anywhere else.  Also, what if there are multiple devices?
Is that a problem to worry about?

The thing is that they aren't related at all in any way.  There's no
reason to tie them together.  In fact, the way we did devcg is
backward.  The ideal solution would have been extending the usual ACL
to understand cgroups so that it's a natural growth of the permission
system.

You're talking about actual hardware resources.  That has nothing to
do with access permissions on device nodes.

I'm kinda doubtful we're gonna have too many of these.  Hardware
details being exposed to userland this directly isn't common.

I'd say keep it simple and do the minimum. :)

Thanks.
