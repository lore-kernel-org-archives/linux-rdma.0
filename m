Yes, it can.  It just becomes a part of kernel ABI that the IB stack
module depends on.

Sure, use parser for parsing but you end up stripping =%d in other
places anyway.  Do it the other way.  Let the definitions contain
what's essential and do the extra stuff in code handling it, not the
other way around.

How is this different from setting the limits to max?

Not really.

Just keeping them around till device destruction would work just fine.
If you wanna insist on freeing them dynamically, free them when both
their usages and configs are nil.  How the object is created shouldn't
be a factor.

See above.  If you want to free dynamically, free when the thing
doesn't contain any information.  Better, just don't worry about it.
It's unlikely to matter.

Yes, it's a clear anti-pattern for a refcnted object.  Again, just
push the locking to the users and drop the atomics.

Two things.  Freeing dynamically doesn't require creator type or
refcnting here, so the code makes no sense to me.  It's complicated
without any purpose.  Second, it's not that big a struct.  Just leave
them around till it's clear that this is problematic.  For the Nth
time in this whole thing, keep things simple.  Stop overengineering.
