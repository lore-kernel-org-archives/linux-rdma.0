Tejun,
The fact is that user level application uses hardware resources.
Verbs layer is software abstraction for it. Drivers are hiding how
they implement this QP or CQ or whatever hardware resource they
project via API layer.
For all of the userland on top of verb layer I mentioned above, the
common resource abstraction is these resources AH, QP, CQ, MR etc.
Hardware (and driver) might have different view of this resource in
their real implementation.
For example, verb layer can say that it has 100 QPs, but hardware
might actually have 20 QPs that driver decide how to efficiently use
it.

Yes. We are still talking of resource abstraction here.
RDMA and IBTA defines these resources. On top of these resources
various frameworks are build.
so for example,
User land is tuning environment deploying for MPI application,
it would configure:
10 processes from the PID controller,
10 CPUs in cpuset controller,
1 PD, 20 CQ, 10 QP, 100 MRs in rdma controller,

say user land is tuning environment for deploying rsocket application
for 100 connections,
it would configure, 100 PD, 100 QP, 200 MR.
When verb layer see failure with it, they will adapt to live with what
they have at lower performance.

Since every higher level which I mentioned in different in the way, it
uses RDMA resources, we cannot generalize it as "N command buffers".
That generalization in my mind is the - rdma resources - central common entity.

o.k. It doesn't have to be useful anywhere else. If it suffice the
need of RDMA applications, its fine for near future.
This patch allows limiting resources across multiple devices.
As we go along the path, and if requirement come up to have knob on
per device basis, thats something we can extend in future.

Its common in RDMA applications. Again they may not be real hardware
resource, its just API layer which defines those RDMA constructs.

o.k. In that case new rdma cgroup controller which does rdma resource
accounting is possibly the most simplest form?
Make sense?
