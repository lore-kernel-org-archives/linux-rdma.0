Yay ... got this up .. amazingly on a uOS that does not have much of
the conventional kernel debug facilities.

The hang was caused by auto disconnect, triggered by xprt->timer. The
task was carried out by xprt_init_autodisconnect(). It silently
disconnects the xprt w/out sensible warning. The uOS is on a
small-core (slower) hardware. Instead of a hard number, this timeout
value needs to be at least a "proc" tunable. Will check newer kernels
to see whether it's been improved and/or draft a patch later.

One thing I'm still scratching my head is that ... by looking at the
raw IOPS, I don't see dramatic difference between NFS-RDMA vs. NFS
over IPOIB (TCP). However, the total run time differs greatly. NFS
over RDMA seems to take a much longer time to finish (vs. NFS over
IPOIB). Not sure why is that .... Maybe by the constant
connect/disconnect triggered by reestablish_timeout ? The connection
re-establish is known to be expensive on this uOS. Why do we need two
sets of timeout where
1. xprt->timer disconnects (w/out reconnect) ?
2. reestablish_timeout constantly disconnect/re-connect ?
