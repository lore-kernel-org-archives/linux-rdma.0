It is interesting to think about the work Long Li did - which shows that
at least on the client side the model doesn't require opening a TCP
connection and doing auth on it before negotiating RDMA.

His smb3 kernel code allows trying SMB3 over RDMA immediately (without first
negotiating whether RDMA is allowed) - obviously finishing multichannel support
in cifs.ko is important, but I was surprised at first that it was
possible to use
RDMA for SMB3 without multichannel.
