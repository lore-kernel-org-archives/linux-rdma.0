As an attempt to abstract the hardware resources only, what these devices are exposing to apps can be viewed as command queues (RDMA QPs and SRQs), notification queues (RDMA CQs and EQs), and space in the device cache and allocated memory (RDMA MRs and AHs, maybe PDs).

If one wanted a higher level of abstraction, associations exist between these resources.  For example, command queues feed into notification queues.  Address handles are required resources to use an unconnected queue pair.
