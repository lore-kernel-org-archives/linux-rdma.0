Thanks!

Assumptions, probably. I believe these assumptions are the same as are
made on the client side. It would be awesome to build an API contract
for struct xdr_buf and have it written down somewhere, then we would
know for sure.

You're thinking of clients that might send more than one READ or WRITE
in and NFSv4 COMPOUND? The thought for the current implementation
is that the first READ or WRITE operation would be allowed to use the
xdr_buf page list, and arguments/results for the remaining READ/WRITE
operations would go inline (ie: a Long Call or Reply with data copy on
both ends).
