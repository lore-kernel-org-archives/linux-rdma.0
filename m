The main purpose of this series is to address connection drop
recovery issues by fixing FRMR re-use to make it less likely the
client will deadlock due to a memory management operation error.
Some clean-ups and other fixes are present as well.

Anna, v4 of this series should be ready for merging.

See topic branch nfs-rdma-for-3.17 in

git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/cel/cel-2.6.git

I tested with NFSv3 and NFSv4 on all three supported memory
registration modes. Used cthon04, iozone, and dbench with both
Solaris and Linux NFS/RDMA servers. Used xfstests with Linux.

v4:

- Rebased on v3.16-rc6

- Add Tested-by: from Shirley Ma and Devesh Sharma


v3:
Only two substantive changes:

- Patch 08/21 now uses generic IB helpers for managing FRMR
 rkeys

- Add Tested-by: from Steve Wise


v2:
Many patches from v1 have been written or replaced.

The MW ref counting approach in v1 is abandoned. Instead, I've
eliminated signaling FAST_REG_MR and LOCAL_INV, and added
appropriate recovery mechanisms after a transport reconnect that
should prevent rkey dis-synchrony entirely.

A couple of optimizations have been added, including:

- Allocating each MW separately rather than carving each out of a
 large piece of contiguous memory

- Now that the receive CQ upcall handler dequeues a bundle of CQEs
 at once, fire off the reply handler tasklet just once per upcall
 to reduce context switches and how often hard IRQs are disabled
