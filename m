Digging into it further, it seems like the Mellanox Infiniband driver
could somehow be involved.  Adding some trace's to the code, it's obvio=
us
something like this is happening:

At some time sq_cq_reap() is called, which ends up like this:

  sq_cq_reap()
    ib_poll_cq()
      mlx4_ib_poll_cq()
        mlx4_ib_poll_one()
          mlx4_ib_handle_error_cqe()
            - Which then sets wc->status to IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR rather
              often, but the killer blow seems to be when
              IB_WC_REM_ACCESS_ERR is set.
    - Because of the error previously, sq_cq_reap sets the XPT_CLOSE
      flag

Then, sometime later:

  fast_reg_read_chunks()
    svc_rdma_fastreg()
      svc_rdma_send()
        svc_rdma_send()
          - XPT_CLOSE is set and hence -ENOTCONN is returned
    - Since svc_rdma_fastreg() had an error fast_reg_read_chunks() bail=
s
      and the client seems to then hang.

I'd ask the infiband guys, what does IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR and
IB_WC_REM_ACCESS_ERR mean?  Is it something drastic that should result
in hangs?

nog.
