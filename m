I can not think of any scenario that would be a bug with O_DIRECT.
Do you have one in mind ? When you fork() and do other syscall that
affect the memory of your process in another thread you should
expect non consistant results. Kernel is not here to provide a fully
safe environement to user, user can shoot itself in the foot and
that's fine as long as it only affect the process itself and no one
else. We should not be in the business of making everything baby
proof :)

What John is addressing has nothing to do with fork() it has to do with
GUP and filesystem page. More specificaly that after page_mkclean() all
filesystem expect that the page content is stable (ie no one write to
the page) with GUP and hardware (DIRECT_IO too) this is not necessarily
the case.

So John is trying to fix that. Not trying to make fork() baby proof
AFAICT :)

I rather keep saying that you should expect weird thing with RDMA and
VFIO when doing fork() than trying to work around this in the kernel.

Better behavior through hardware is what we should aim for (CAPI, ODP,
...).
