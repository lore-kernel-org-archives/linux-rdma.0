Is it actually customary to have rdma core module updated more
frequently separate from the kernel?  Out-of-tree modules being
updated separately happens quite a bit but this is an in-kernel
module, which usually is tightly coupled with the rest of the kernel.

I don't remember the details well but the code was vastly more complex
back then and the object lifetime management was muddy at best.  If I
reviewed in a contradicting way, my apologies, but given the current
code, it'd be better to have objects creation upfront.

Yes, I meant adding pool->parent field.  Hierarchical operations
become far simpler with the invariant that parent always exists.

It isn't necessarily about speed.  It makes clear that the parent
always should exist and makes the code easier to read and update.

I mean that it isn't particularly difficult to overflow a s32 when
adding up multiple usages into one.

Yeah, sure, it needs protection.  I was wondering why it needed to be
a separate mutex.  The only sleeping operations seem to be the ones
which can be done before or with acquiring rpool_list_lock, no?

You're summing up all usages instead of counting the number of !0
usages.

So, whether the counters are separate or not doesn't matter that much
but it's awkward that it's counting the number of !max entries for
limits while summing the actual usages (instead of counting the number
of !0 usages) especially given that it gets summed into an int
counter.  Wouldn't counting !max limit && !0 usage be more consistent?

I meant you don't need the allocation at all.

	lock;
	for_each_dev() {
		pool = lookup_pool();
		for_each_field()
			seq_printf(sf, "%s ", name, pool_val(pool, index));
	}
	unlock;

I don't know why you end up missing basic patterns so badly.  It's
making the review and iteration process pretty painful.  Please don't
be confrontational and try to read the review comments assuming good
will.

Thanks.
