Tejun,
That is such a perfect abstraction to have at OS level, but not sure
how much close it can be to bare metal RDMA it can be.
I have started discussion on that front as well as part of other
thread, but its certainly long way to go.
Most want to enjoy the performance benefit of the bare metal
interfaces it provides.

Such abstraction that you mentioned, exists, the only difference is
instead of its OS as central entity, its the higher level libraries,
drivers and hw together does it today for the applications.

Well, all the interfaces are not yet defined. Except the test and
benchmark utilities, real world applications wouldn't really bother
much about which device are they are going through.
so I expect that per device level control would nice for very specific
applications, but I don't anticipate that in first place.
If others have different view, I would be happy to hear that.

Even if we extend per device control, I would expect per cgroup
control at top level without which its uncontrolled access.

o.k. thanks. I would wait for some more time to collect more feedback.
In absence of that,

I will send updated patch V1 which will include,
(a) functionality of this patch in new rdma cgroup as you recommended,
(b) fixes for comments from Haggai for this patch
(c) more fixes which I have done in mean time
