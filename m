My understanding is that you're describing a wire protocol correct?

The challenge in my mind would be to have persistence semantics in
place.

Umm, you don't need the 2M to be contiguous in order to represent them
as a single RDMA handle. If that was true iSER would have never worked.
Or I misunderstood what you meant...
