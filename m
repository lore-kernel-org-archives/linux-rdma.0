The mlx5 approach is much better than allocating a whole
page, when you consider platforms with 64KB pages.

A 1MB payload (for NFS) on such a platform comprises just
16 pages. So xprtrdma will allocate MRs with support for
16 pages. That's a priv pages array of 128 bytes, and you
just put it in a 64KB page all by itself.

So maybe adding 2048 bytes is not optimal either. But I
think sticking with kmalloc here is a more optimal choice.

There certainly isn't, but that doesn't mean there can't
be a bug somewhere ;-) and maybe not in dma_map_single.
It could be that the "array on one page only" limitation
is somewhere else in the mlx4 driver, or even in the HCA
firmware.

I think we demonstrated pretty clearly that the issue
occurs only when the end of the priv pages array crosses
into a new page.

We didn't see any problem otherwise.

The reason I find this hard to believe is that there is
no end alignment guarantee at all in this code, but it
works without issue when SLUB debugging is not enabled.

xprtrdma allocates 256 elements in this array on x86.
The code makes the array start on an 0x40 byte boundary.
I'm pretty sure that means the end of that array will
also be on at least an 0x40 byte boundary, and thus
aligned to the DMA cacheline, whether or not SLUB
debugging is enabled.

Notice that in the current code, if the consumer requests
an odd number of SGs, that array can't possibly end on
an alignment boundary. But we've never had a complaint.

SLUB debugging changes the alignment of lots of things,
but mlx4_alloc_priv_pages is the only breakage that has
been reported.

DMA-API.txt says:

The way I read this, cacheline alignment shouldn't be
an issue at all, as long as DMA cachelines aren't
shared between mappings.

If I simply increase the memory allocation size a little
and ensure the end of the mapping is aligned, that should
be enough to prevent DMA cacheline sharing with another
memory allocation on the same page. But I still see Local
Protection Errors when SLUB debugging is enabled, on my
system (with patches to allocate more pages per MR).

I'm not convinced this has anything to do with DMA
cacheline alignment. The reason your patch fixes this
issue is because it keeps the entire array on one page.
