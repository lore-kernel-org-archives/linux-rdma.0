*Older* Mellanox adapters. mlx5 (and future drivers I assume) will
no longer support FMRs.

We should gradually move away from that.

I'm willing to add a proper memory_registration.txt under
Documentation/infiniband/ which would capture the items that
were brought up here.

It's better if you want it fast. I can't stress it enough, but IMO, the
fallback should *not* be in the API, but rather in the ULP.
Ideally, at some point it won't need to fall back, and we can remove
the API.

Someone needs a good reason to use it.
