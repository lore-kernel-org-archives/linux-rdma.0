Actually not. They are linked resources. Every QP needs associated one
or two CQ, one PD.
Every QP will use few MRs for data transfer.
Here is the good programming guide of the RDMA APIs exposed to the
user space application.

http://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/prod_software/RDMA_Aware_Programming_user_manual.pdf
So first version of the cgroups patch will address the control
operation for section 3.4.

There is higher level abstraction which is through the verbs layer
currently which does actually expose the hardware resource but in
vendor agnostic way.
There are many vendors who support these verbs layer, some of them
which I know are Mellanox, Intel, Chelsio, Avago/Emulex whose drivers
which support these verbs are in <drivers/infiniband/hw/> kernel tree.

There is higher level APIs above the verb layer, such as MPI,
libfabric, rsocket, rds, pgas, dapl which uses underlying verbs layer.
They all rely on the hardware resource. All of these higher level
abstraction is accepted and well used by certain application class. It
would be long discussion to go over them here.

Some of the higher level examples I gave above will adapt to resource
allocation failure. Some are actually adaptive to few resource
allocation failure, they do query resources. But its not completely
there yet. Once we have this notion of limited resource in place,
abstraction layer would adapt to relatively smaller value of such
resource.
These higher level abstraction is mainstream. Its shipped at least in
Redhat Enterprise Linux.

I agree that resource won't be common in next-gen other transport
whenever they arrive.
But with my existing background working on some of those transport,
they appear similar in nature and it might seek similar knobs.

I do agree that currently cgroup doesn't have notion of sub cgroup or
above hierarchy today.
so until than I was considering to implement it under devices cgroup
as generic place without the hierarchy shown above.
Therefore current interface is at device cgroup level.

If you are suggesting to have rdma cgroup as separate entity for near
future, its fine with me.
Later on when next-gen arrives we might have scope to make rdma cgroup
as more generic one. But than it might look like what I described
above.

In past I have discussions with Liran Liss from Mellanox as well on
this topic and we also agreed to have such cgroup controller.
He has recent presentation at Linux foundation event indicating to
have cgroup for RDMA.
Below is the link to it.
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/containing_rdma_final.pdf
Slides 1 to 7 and slide 13 will give you more insight to it.
Liran and I had similar presentation to RDMA audience with less slides
in RDMA openfabrics summit in March 2015.

I am ok to create separate cgroup for rdma, if community thinks that way.
My preference would be still use device cgroup for above extensions
unless there are fundamental issues that I am missing.
I would let you make the call.
Rdma and other is just another type of device with different
characteristics than character or block, so one device cgroup with sub
functionalities can allow setting knobs.
Every device category will have their own set of knobs for resources,
ACL, limits, policy.
And I think cgroup is certainly better control point than sysfs or
spinning of new control infrastructure for this.
That said, I would like to hear your and communities view on how they
would like to see this shaping up.
