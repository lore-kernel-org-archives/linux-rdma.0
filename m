This view makes sense to me as well. Can someone also confirm that
using TSS doesn't affect the on-the-wire packets vs the non-TSS cases?
I heard a few comments that sounded like TSS users get a per-queue QPN
in the outgoing packet rather than a single QPN for the group, which
would be pretty ugly.

IMHO, this sort of stuff needs to have a very well defined on-the-wire
behaviour, even if it is just documented in the ibverbs man pages.

Yah, an API that made work queues a sub object of the QP seems to make
much more sense than trying to manage an array of QPs.
