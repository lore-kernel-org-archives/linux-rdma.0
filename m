By the way, just to be clear: If you use a FRWR, you by definition only have one SGE entry as the result of the registration.  So
regardless of what a device/protocol can do with the destination SGE of an RDMA READ operation, if you use FRWR to register the
destination region, you need only 1 SGE in the RDMA READ WR.
