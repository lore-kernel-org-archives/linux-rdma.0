I think you misunderstood the receiver buffers. They are posted so the remo=
te peer can post a send. The remote peer's receive credit is calculated bas=
ed on how many receive buffer have been posted.  The code doesn't assume on=
e post_send needs one corresponding post_recv. In practice, receive buffers=
 are posted as soon as possible to extend receive credits to the remote pee=
r.

The code behaves exactly the same as you described. It uses a constant to d=
ecide how many receive buffer to post. It's not very smart and can be impro=
ved.
