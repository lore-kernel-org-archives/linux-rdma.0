The part improving the kthread worker API and the intel powerclamp
conversion seem to be ready for the mainline. But it is getting too late
for 4.7.

I am going to resend this part of the patch set separately after
the 4.7 merge window finishes with the aim for 4.8. The other
conversions are spread over many subsystems, so I will send
them separately.

Tejun, may I add your ack for some of the patches, please?
Or do you want to wait for the resend?

Andrew, I wonder if it could go via the -mm tree once I get
the acks.

Best Regards,
Petr
