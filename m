ib_uverbs_dereg_mr() needs a fix in my patch for MW and alloc_mw()
also needs to use it.
I will fix it.

No. I will look into the structure and see if it fits or not.

In  hierarchy, of say 3 cgroups, the smallest limit of the cgroup is applied.

Lets take example to clarify.
Say cg_A, cg_B, cg_C
Role              name                           limit
Parent           cg_A                           100
Child_level1  cg_B (child of cg_A)    20
Child_level2: cg_C (child of cg_B)    50

If the process allocating rdma resource belongs to cg_C, limit lowest
limit in the hierarchy is applied during charge() stage.
If cg_A limit happens to be 10, since 10 is lowest, its limit would be
applicable as you expected.
this is similar to newly added PID subsystem in functionality.

o.k. This is typo mistake from usage show function I made. I will change it.

This is similar to following other controller same as newly added PID
subsystem in showing max limit.

I believe, its not required because when uncharge() is happening, it
can happen only from 3 contexts.
(a) from the caller task context, who has made allocation call, so no
synchronizing needed.
(b) from the dealloc resource context, again this is from the same
task context which allocated, it so this is single threaded, no need
to syncronize.
(c) from the fput() context when process is terminated abruptly or as
part of differed cleanup, when this is happening there cannot be
allocator task anyway.

No. this is the caller task allocating it, so its single threaded.
It needs to syncronize with migration thread which is reading counters
of all the processes, while they are getting allocated and freed.
Therefore rcu() is sufficient.
