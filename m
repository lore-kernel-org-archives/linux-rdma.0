No. We agreed that let IB stack define in the header file that rdmacg
can include.
However when I started with that I realized that, such design has
basic flaw that IB stack is compiled as loadable modules.
cgroup which is compiled along with kernel, cannot rely on the header
file of the loadable module, as it will lead to incompatibly and
possible crash.
Therefore its defined as indirect table. So instead of a callback, it
can be further simplified to return as pointer to data structure
stored in the rdmacg_device (similar to the name field).
Would that be reasonable?

No. As explained above, structure size and num fields are constant, so
lets do above way, without a callback function.

Match token is being used in other places also typically where user
configuration is involved.
so Match token infrastructure APIs help to avoid rewriting parser.
What exactly is the issue in using match token?
Resource type is fixed - sure it is with given version of loadable
module. But if new feature/resource is added in IB stack, at that
point new token will be added in the array.

Let me try to take example.
Say there is one device and 100 cgroups, with single hierarchy.
Out of which 15 are active cgroups allocating rdma resources, rest 85
are not active in terms of rdma resource usage.
So rpool object is created for those 15 cgroups (regardless of user
has configured limits or not).

In this design its not tied to the lifetime of the device. At the
sametime if device goes away, those 15 will be freed anyway because
device doesn't exist.

Now coming to remove command's need.
If user has previously configured limit of say mr=15. Now if wants to
remove that configuration and don't want to bother for the limit.
So the way, its done is by issuing "remove" command.
Should I name is "reset".
When user issues "remove" command it could still happen that there are
active rdma resources. So we cannot really free the rpool object.
That is freed when last resource is uncharged.
Make sense?

As in above example of 15-85, if we keep it or create is we will end
up allocating rpool objects for all the 100 cgroups, which might not
be necessary. If it happens to be multi level hierarchy, it will end
up having in each level.
So therefore its allocated and freed dynamically.

If its created by user configuration, and if we free the rpool object
when last resource is freed which is holding the configuration,
user configuration is lost.
Also it doesn't make much sense to have two different allocation for
limit and usage configuration. Pointer storing overhead is more than
the actual content.

Help me to understand, silly means - unacceptable?
I am still trying to understand why a wrapper function makes the code buggy.

Why you don't want them to be freed when there are no requester
allocating the resource?
Device usually stays for longer time, but applications go way and come
back more often, so freeing them makes more sense when not in use.
What exactly is the problem in freeing when uncharing occurs, due to
which I should defer it to device unregistration stage?

I understand that. Instead of individual driver, it can be well
abstracted out at IB stack level that drivers will use.
So that it will be in cgroup.c or other file, but with that I don't
anticipate a design change.
I have not received review comments from Sean Hefty or any of the
Intel folks who requested this feature.
So I will keep this feature around for a while. I will ping him as
well to finish his reviews and if there is any resource definitions
that they can spell out.
In absence of those inputs, other possibility is to just define verb
level resource. I am keeping doors open for more review comments from
IB folks on how do they see this.
