Is this lock still being used?

It's a bit bothering that resource type defs are outside the
controller in a way the controller can't know and assumed to have the
same type and range.  Architecting kernel code so that allow building
modules separately can modify behaviors usually isn't a priority and
styling things like this makes implementing specific one-off behaviors
cumbersome.

It now looks okay but let's say in the future someone wants to use a
different type and/or ranges for one of the resources, given the above
framework, that person is most likely to blow up pool_info - first
with types and min, max values and maybe later with callback handlers
and so on, when the only thing which would have been necessary is an
one-off handling of that specific setting in the interface functions.

Making things modular comes at the cost of complexity and ad-hoc
flexiblity.  There are cases where such overhead is warranted but as I
mentioned before, I don't think this is one of them.  Please look back
on how this patchset developed.  It has been a continuous process of
cutting down complexities which didn't need to be there which is the
opposite of what we usually want to do - buliding up sophiscation and
complexity as necessary from something simple.  Please cut down this
part too.

Does this still need to be a separate lock?

Can you please prefix the above with rdmacg?

Ditto, how about rdmacg_dev_list?

Isn't it more conventional to use OBJ_list or OBJs for the head and
_node or _link for the members?

* It's usually a good idea to have hierarchical objects to be created
  all the way to the root when a leaf node is requested and link
  parent at each level.  That way, when a descendant object is looked
  up, the caller can always deref its ->parent pointer till it reaches
  the top.

* Unless it's a very hot path, using a mutex which protects creation
  of new nodes is usually simpler than doing alloc -> lock ->
  try-insert.  The concurrency in the creation path doesn't matter and
  even if it mattered it isn't a good idea to bang on allocation path
  concurrently anyway.

So, with each pool linking to its parent, instead of looking up at
each level, it can just follow ->parent recursively.

What guarantees that this count wouldn't overflow?  More on this
later.

Hmm... what css ref is the above putting?

Here, too, you can look up the leaf node once and walk up the
hierarhcy.  Maybe create a helper, say rdmacg_get_pool_and_lock(),
which looks up an existing node or creates all pools from leaf to root
and returns with the lock held?

If some resources are not very plentiful and contended, dropping lock
before error handling like above could lead to spurious failures.  It
looks like the above is from trying to create pool at each level while
charging up.  Creating all necessary pools at the outset should make
the code simpler and more robust.

Ditto, where is this from?

Ditto with lookup here.

lockdep_assert_held() would be nice.

Hmm... except for new_limits allocation and alloc_cg_rpool()
invocation, both of which can be done at the head of the function,
nothing seems to require a mutex here.  If we move them to the head of
the function, can we get rid of dev_mutex entirely?

Maybe we can use for_each_set_bit()?

Can't we just count the number of resources which either have !max
setting or !0 usage?

Do we need this type of interface?  Why not let the caller look up the
target pool and call this function with pool and resource index?

Thanks.
