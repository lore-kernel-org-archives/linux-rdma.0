Ok sounds good.

True, but I think there's a bit more to it. For example, the buffer
cache is pinned, but the data on the page isn't dedicated to an i/o,
it's shared among file-layer stuff. Of course, a file-layer RDMA
protocol needs to play by those rules, but I'll use it as a warning
that it's not always simple.

Totally agree that kernel memory handling is easier than userspace,
and also that userspace APIs need to have appropriate kernel setup.
Note, this wasn't always the case. In the 2.4 days, when we first
coded the NFS/RDMA client, there was some rather ugly stuff.

Yeah, and the important takeaway is that a memory registration API
can't hide this - meaning, the upper layer needs to address it (hah!).
Often, once an upper layer has to do this, it can do better by doing
it itself. But that's perhaps too philosophical here. Let me just
say that transparency has proved to be the enemy of performance.

Hmm, most of these are userspace API experiences, and I would not be
so quick as to dismiss their applicability, or their lessons. There
was the old "kvipl" (kernel VI Provider Library), which had certain
simple memreg functions, but I'm not sure that API was ever in the
public domain (it was Intel's). There's kDAPL, based on DAPL which is
actually successful but exposes a somewhat different memory registration
model. And Solaris has an abstraction, which I haven't looked at
in years.

Up a layer, you might look into Portals, the many MPI implementations,
and maybe even some network shared memory stuff like clusters. Most of
these have been implemented as layers atop verbs (among others).
