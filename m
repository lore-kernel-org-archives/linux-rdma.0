Unfortunately, the userspace don't get the size of the returned data:
it's only a single "write()" syscall after all.

So the kernel is left with the comp_mask in the response to express
the returned size.

It's not (yet) about drivers as the output's comp_mask (in the=20
response), is set by uverbs layer.

Do you think we have to enforce a 1 to 1 relation between the request=20
comp_mask's bits and the response comp_mask's bits ?

That would not fit with my understanding of "Extending Verbs API"=20
presentation [1]: request's comp_mask describe the fields present in=20
the request and response's comp_mask describe the fields present in the=
=20
response.

That's not how I've understand the purpose of the request's comp_mask
after reading the presentation: request's comp_mask describe the conten=
t
of the request. Then that additional content can trigger the presence=20
of additional fields in the response if needed.

>=20

It's not at all OK to ignore request's comp_mask: it has to be checked
to find if there's a feature requested the kernel cannot fullfil, and=20
any unknown bit is a possible feature request. So the kernel has to=20
reject the request as a whole as it don't know how to process it.

As we don't know yet how we would extend the extended QUERY_DEVICE
uverbs, the kernel have to refuse any random value.

I believe every interface should return an error for any unknown value
(every unused bits of a data structure), that is, there's only one case=

I have to have a look to this part of libibverbs: I'm not sure
the extended QUERY_DEVICE is already implemented.

I hope you would find some time to review my latest patchset
so that we don't miss a corner case. It's starting to become urgent.
