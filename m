I had an interesting conversation with some Lustre devs where they
were very concerned that FMR was going to be removed and they didn't really
seem to even know that FRMR existed.

I'm sure their PHYS_MR usage is crufty old code to support old
adaptors.

And again, here is a great example of how the API is not helping the
ULPs do what they want to do. Lustre doesn't care one bit about this
stuff, they just want to send messages..
