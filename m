I looked at the consumers of sg_alloc_table_chained, and
all these callers are immediately doing ib_dma_map_sg.

Nothing in svc_rdma_rw.c does a DMA map. It relies on
rdma_rw_ctx_init for that, and that API is passed a
scatterlist.

I don't see how I could use sg_alloc_table_chained here,
unless rdma_rw_ctx_init was modified to take a chained
sg_table instead of a scatterlist argument.

I suppose I could convert the client side to use it?
What do you think?

I fixed this up, I think it is an improvement. Thanks for
the suggestion.
