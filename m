Two observations.

One, auth is an Upper Layer matter. It's not the job of the transport
to authenticate the peer, the user, etc. Upper layers do this, and
iSCSI performs a login, NFSv4.1+ creates a session, SMB3 creates
sessions on multiple connections, etc. All this happens after the
connection is established.

Two, the iSCSI and NFSv4.1 protocols have explicit support for iWARP
"step-up" mode, which supports an initial connection in TCP (i.e.
with RDMA disabled), and switching to RDMA mode dynamically.

The IB and RoCE protocols do not support step-up mode, so in fact
one could argue that iWARP is *better* positioned to support this.
