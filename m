Excellent, but is that 95K IOPS a typo? At 4KB, that's less than 400MBps.

What is the client CPU percentage you see under this workload, and
how different are the NFS/RDMA and NFS/IPoIB overheads?

You'll need to do more profiling to track that down. I would suspect
that ib_send_bw is using some sort of direct hardware access, bypassing
the IOMMU management and possibly performing no dynamic memory registration.

The NFS/RDMA code goes via the standard kernel DMA API, and correctly
registers/deregisters memory on a per-i/o basis in order to provide
storage data integrity. Perhaps there are overheads in the IOMMU
management which can be addressed.
