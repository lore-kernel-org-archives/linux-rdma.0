Hello, chiming in late.

Yeap, it should definitely be separate from device cgroup.

I'm *extremely* uncomfortable with this.  Drivers for this sort of
higher end devices tend to pull a lot of stunts for better or worse
and my gut feeling is that letting low level drivers run free with
resource definition is highly likely to lead to an unmanageable mess
in the long run.  I'd strongly urge to gather consensus on what the
resources should be across the board.

Heh, 4 seems like an arbitrary number.  idk, it feels weird to bake in
a number like 4 into the design.

So, the usual way to deal with this is that the root cgroup is exempt
from accounting and each resource tracks where they were charged to
and frees that cgroup on release.  IOW, asssociate on charge and
maintain the association till release.

For interface details, please refer to the following documentation.
