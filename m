Looking at the code, the usage in every level is charged. This is what I
would expect. I just think the comment is a bit misleading.

Okay.

I don't think it is true. You can access uverbs from multiple threads.
What may help your case here I think is the fact that only when the last
ucontext is released you can change the rdma_res_counter field, and
ucontext release takes the ib_uverbs_file->mutex.

Still, I think it would be best to use rcu_dereference(), if only for
documentation and sparse.
