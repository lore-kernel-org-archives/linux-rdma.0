Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to do.

It's a hint because the kernel also have to check the size match:
if userspace say: "hey I've given you more fields" but the request
size is shorter than the kernel expect for such fields, the kernel
must return an error so that userspace is taught to fix its requests.

I think it's better to stick to one common behavior so that every
extended uverbs behave the same way.

I tried to explain the issue regarding older userspace setting random
bits in request's comp_mask: it older kernel allows such, the same
program will likely have issue with newer kernel where the request's
comp_mask bits have a meaning now: the program will either face
unknown behavior: the kernel does something the userspace was not
expecting, or the kernel refuse to do it because there's not enough
information in the request to fullfil it.

That's why we must catch now unknown value to prevent userspace to
use it now. If unknown value are not allowed, userspace program won't
use it and then it could run asis on newer kernel.

Yes. This scheme follow the "Extending Verbs API" presention
while ensuring the command can be extended regarding to good
practice one can find in
http://blog.ffwll.ch/2013/11/botching-up-ioctls.html

I'm going to submit the patches to have this behavior.
