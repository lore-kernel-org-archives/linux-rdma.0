Okay, yes, I see, the flow is different for the ex versions from the
non-ex versions.

Indeed, I forgot the scheme used that indirection buffer with
pointers. My comments on write() result are all wrong. Sorry

The patch it is good, but sitting this into the larger framework where
we have libibverbs consumers compiled against arbitrary versions of
the structure creates a broader complexity that someone has to deal
with.

libibverbs needs to ensure the trailer portion of the structure from
the end user is 0'd.

Yes, but my point is that comp mask bit should only be used to protect
fields where 0 is not an acceptable 'do not support' answer.

Primarily we should rely on memset(0) to provide compatibility, and
only when really necessary introduce a comp mask bit.

This is why the size is important, we can't deduce the size from
comp_mask, and without the size we can't know where the kernel stopped
writing and the whole thing becomes a little more fragile.

Zeroing the response buffer before calling into the kernel is not a
great general pattern.

Perhaps having the kernel zero the trailing portion it doesn't write
too is okay, but it still feels like not telling user space the size
is asking for future trouble.

Yes. But understand it is selected to try and provide a good end user
experience, exposing structure versions or size directly to the user
is very difficult to work with.

Ideally the end user will not see many comp mask bits (ie I would drop
the ODP one) and things will 'just work' as compiled.
