I think you are right, it's true for networking.

Whenever someone tries to benchmark networking, first thing done is
always disabling irqbalance and pinning IRQs manually away from
whereever the benchmark is running, but at the same numa node.

Without that, interrupts don't let the benchmark make progress.

Alternatively, people give up on interrupts completely and
start polling hardware aggressively. Nice for a benchmark,
not nice for the environment.

IMHO there could be a benefit from a better integration with the scheduler.
Maybe an interrupt handler can be viewed as a kind of thread,
so scheduler can make decisions about where to run it next?
