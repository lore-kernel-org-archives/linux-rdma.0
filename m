That seems weird to me, from looking at the code I didn't see
any indication that such a mapping would fail. Maybe we are seeing
a mlx4 specific issue? If this is some kind of generic dma-mapping
bug mlx5 would suffer from the same problem right? does it?

If a single page boundary is indeed the root-cause then I agree
this would not solve the problem for mlx5.

The mlx4 PRM explicitly states that the translation (pages) vector
should align to 64 bytes and this is where this define comes from,
hence I don't think it should be removed from the code.
