Ahh, right. There can be chain of wr.

right.

RDS assumes it's an offset and hence it has been used as 32 bit. I need
to look through this carefully though because all the existing
application use this header format. There is also RDMA read/write
byte information sent as part of the header(Not in upstream code yet)
so the space might be less. But point taken. Will look into it.

Unfortunately this change still doesn't fix the issue.

Will look into it. Thanks for suggestion.
