Thats what I was suggesting to Leon.

When 100% is given to one cgroup, all resources of all type can be
charged by processes of that cgroup.
Resources are stateful resource. So when cgroup goes away, they go
back to global pool (or hw).
Giving 100% to two cgroups is configuration error anyway (or without config).

Yes. This still holds true. I don't think anything changed.
proportional knob by kernel provides constrained know of equally
distribute all type of resources.
This works only on one class of application. Thats the primary reason
we had knob for verb level well defined resource.

(Which is subset of what patchv12 had to offer, where such
configuration can be done by the user space).

What is not part of patchv12 is - currently max limit is configured as
"max", instead of real max value.
Due to which user space tool is unable to configure exact value to
program to achieve functionality of ratio.
This new functionality can be done post this patch as this is
incremental functionality for user space tools.

As you know weight configuration allows automatic increase/decrease of
resource to other cgroups when one of them go away, as opposed to
absolute value. How this is going to work in exact terms for stateful
resource, we don't know yet. I haven't though through the design
either from kernel side. So just started exploring if weight interface
can be leveraged.

Nop. Thats not true.
(a) Every new resource has to be defined in cgroup_rdma.h
(b) charge()/uncharge() has to happen by the cgroup for each.
(c) Letting drivers do will make things fall apart. There are no APIs
exposed either to let drivers know process cgroup either. There is no
intention either.

(d) ratio means -if adapter has
100 resources of type - A,
80 resource of type - B,

10% for cgroup-1 means,
10 resource of type - A
8 resource of type - B
