Absolute number of percentage is representation for a given property.
That property needs definition. Isn't it?
How do we say that "Some undefined" resource you give certain amount,
which user doesn't know about what to administer, or configure.
It has to be quantifiable entity.

Why does the user need to know the actual hardware resource limits or
define hardware based resource.

RDMA verbs is the abstraction point.
We could well define
(a) how many number of RDMA connections are allowed instead of QP, or CQ or AH.
(b) how many data transfer buffers to use.

The fact is we have so many mid layers, which uses these resources
differently, above abstraction does not fit the bill.
But we know the mid layers how they operate, and how they use the RDMA
resource keeping.
So if we deploy MPI application for given cluster of container, we can
accurately configure the RDMA resource, isn't it?

Another example would be, if we don't want only 50% resources to be
given to all containers and rest 50% to kernel consumers such as NFS,
all containers can reside in single rdma cgroup limited to given
limits.

Container application always write a simple for loop code to take away
majority of QP with 10MB limit.

Right. we need to define this resource pool, right?
Why it cannot be verbs abstraction?
How many resources are really used to implement verb layer in reality
is left to hardware vendor
Abstract pool just added confusion instead of clarity.

Imagine instead of tcp_bytes or kmem bytes, its "some memory
resource", how would someone debug/tune a system with abstract knobs?

Container is the prime case. Additionally equally prime case of non
container use case.
Today, application can take up all the resource being first class
citizan, and NFS mount will fail.
So without container also we should be able to restrict resources to
user mode app.

Some drivers performs mmap() of kernel memory to user space, some
drivers does user space page allocation and maps to device.
Putting or tracking all those is just so intrusive changes spreading
down the vendor drivers or ib layer which may not be right way to
track.
Memory allocation tracking I believe should be left to memcg.

If we dont care about resource, we cannot tune or limit it. number of
MRs used by MPI vs rsocket vs accelio is way different.
