But there's currently *NO* such mean that could give a hint to userspac=
e
developer whether one bit of request's comp_mask is currently effective
in extended QUERY_DEVICE uverbs. While we have such mean in CREATE_FLOW
and DESTROY_FLOW: unsupported bits trigger -EINVAL.

In QUERY_DEVICE, userspace developer is allowed to set request's=20
comp_mask to -1: it won't hurt it on current kernel, so why not using=20
this value or any other random value ? The program will run: it's "Work=
s
=46or Me".

But the same program (either binary or source code) might fail on
newer kernel where some bits in comp_mask gain a meaning not supported
by the program.

How can the struct format remain the same, if some fields are added
to implement newer feature ?

>=20

Thanks for the link to the presentation.

As I read it the presentation:

- in request, comp_mask give hint to the kernel of additional fields in
the request.

- in response, comp_mask give hint to userspace regarding the presence
of additional fields in the response.

But commit 860f10a799c8 ("IB/core: Add flags for on demand paging
support") on top of commit 5a77abf9a97a ("IB/core: Add support for
extended query device caps") is not doing it the expected way
as one bit set in request's comp_mask has direct effect on
the response's fields.

To be conformant with the "Extending Verbs API" presentation,
no check should be done on request's comp_mask, and on-demand paging
information should be returned to userspace in all case, provided=20
there's enough room in the response buffer.

Anyway, allowing userspace to set any "hint" in the request's comp_mask
is opening a pandora box: being allowed to set any value, userspace
program will use any random value, as it will work with current kernel.

But the same program used on newer kernel is going to trigger some
behavior unknown to the application or return an error the application
is not ready to handle ... breaking any kind of forward compatibility=20
promise.

It's likely the kernel will have to use the size of the request to=20
guess the hints in comp_mask are corrects to handle such. In such case,=
=20
relying only on the size of the request might be enough to detect=20
extended request, without the need for comp_mask.

Regarding the answer, if the response buffer is smaller than the size
of the extended response, will the kernel keep setting the response's=20
comp_mask with all the bits it supports or will it unset the bits for=20
the fields it wasn't able to fit in the response buffer ?

It's likely the kernel will have to use the size of the response buffer=
=20
to set the response's comp_mask.=20

Instead commit 860f10a799c8 ("IB/core: Add flags for on demand paging
support") on top of commit 5a77abf9a97a ("IB/core: Add support for
extended query device caps") make it possible for the kernel to return
truncated response with full comp_mask. Such is going to break silently=
=20
when one will introduce a data structure with an ABI mismatch between
userspace and kernel (for example x86 vs amd64 ... we have some recent
exemples).

>=20

Returning as much as possible information to userspace is OK,
but it's doing it the wrong way.

I'm not specifically discussing QUERY_DEVICE, as I'm concerned with=20
every extended uverbs to be added to the kernel.

You cannot ensure the userspace being correct when specifying a request=
=2E
It's a wrong assumption (perhaps not so wrong in the case of
InfiniBand/RDMA, as most userspace program are using libibverbs,
librdmacm and provider's libraries).

That's why we must not be liberal with the request and check any bit of
it for being something valid, so that erroneous values are catch now,
ensuring userspace is not trying to request things we don't know yet
and it's not aware of it too.

But older userspace programs with newer kernel might break, as request'=

comp_mask was allowed to contains invalid values in older kernel.

Why not, but it's a minor point.

I'm sorry about that but I cannot agree with the current scheme.
