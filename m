Marshaling each segment happens unconditionally in the
svc_rdma_xdr_encode_array_chunk() call just before this
comment. I really do mean "Do not send" here: the patch
is intended to squelch the RDMA Write of the XDR pad for
this chunk.

Perhaps "Do not write" would be more precise, but Bruce
has already committed this patch, IIRC.

I'm checking for chunk_no != 0, for exactly the reasons
you mentioned.
