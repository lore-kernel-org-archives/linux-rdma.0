=46or user-space to make use of on demand paging, it should verify the
specific transport and operation is supported. If they don't, they will
encounter errors when a page fault occurs.

I would prefer it if Yann's patches are accepted. I understand it is

As a second option, in case you prefer to revert the extended query
