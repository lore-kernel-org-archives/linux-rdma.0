The major trouble with that is that the new MR types work by posting
work to the send queue, that work creates the MR.

I don't know all the details of how those schemes work, but it doesn't
look like it fits into this model ?

Maybe if rdma_register_sg was the only API and it accepted a QP, under
the hood it could re-use a pooled/create a non-queued (F)MR, or issue
FRMR, or work with indirect?

It would be nice if it is that simple :)

Sagi, are FMRs, FRMRs and Indirect MRs documented any place? I can't
recall off hand if FRMR was ever published by the IBTA?
