Shared page tables would require the HW to walk the page table format
of the CPU directly, not sure how that would be possible for ODP?

Presumably the implementation for ARM relies on the IOMMU hardware
doing this?

Well, I would think you'd add SVA support to the VFIO driver as a
generic capability - it seems pretty useful for any VFIO user as it
avoids all the kernel upcalls to do memory pinning and DMA address
translation.

Once the VFIO driver knows about this as a generic capability then the
device it exposes to userspace would use CPU addresses instead of DMA
addresses.

The question is if your driver needs much more than the device
agnostic generic services VFIO provides.

I'm not sure what you have in mind with resource management.. It is
hard to revoke resources from userspace, unless you are doing
kernel syscalls, but then why do all this?
