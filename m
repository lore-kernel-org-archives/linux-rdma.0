I wasn't referring to a software interface, but interface to the HW.  A device like usNIC should not have to depend on ib_core and ib_mad because it wants to expose its interfaces up to user space.  That makes no sense.  I'm pretty sure that we're going to continue to disagree on this.

The RDMA stack currently allows drivers to export their own interfaces directly to user space.  At this point, I see no reason why we should block a driver for following what has been an acceptable practice for years.  Dennis fixed the write/writev issue, which would make the hfi1 driver the only device in the RDMA tree with an acceptable interface.

If the RDMA "community" defines the ultimate ioctl interface ever created, great.  Every driver added after that interface has been defined and merged can be forced to use it.
