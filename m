As it is a fairly isolated domain, to certain extent, it could be okay
to let it go.  At the same time, I know that these enterprise things
tend to go completely wayward and am worried about individual drivers
going crazy with custom attributes in a non-sensical way.  The
interface this patch is proposing easily allows that and that at the
cost of internal engineering flexibility.  I don't really want to be
caught up in a situation where we're forced to include broken usages
because that's what's already out in the wild.  I personally would
much prefer the resources to be defined rigidly.  Let's see how the
discussion with Christoph evolves.

In the original review message, I mentioned creating an interface
which creates the hierarchy of objects as necessary and returns the
target pool with lock held, can you please give it a shot?  Something
like the following.

pool *get_pool(...)
{
	lock;
	if (target pool exists)
		return pool w/ lock held;

	create the pool hierarchically (might involve unlock);
	if (succeeded)
		return pool w/ lock held;
	return NULL w/o lock;
}

Sure, create pools only for the used combinations but do that
hierarchically so that a child pool always has a parent.  I can
promise you that the code will read a lot better with that.

seq_printf() can be called from any context; otherwise, it would be a
horrible interface to use, wouldn't it?

Thanks.
