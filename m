If drivers are broken due to ignorance of not-calling cgroup APIs,
that should be ok.
That particular driver should fix it.
If the resource creation using uverbs is using well defined rdma level
resource, uverbs level will make sure to honor cgroup limits without
involving hw drivers anyway.

RDMA Verb level resource is charged/uncharged by RDMA core.
RDMA HW level resource is charged/uncharged by RDMA HW driver using
well defined API and resource by cgroup core.
This scheme ensures that there is 1:1 mapping.

I don't think current definition of resource type is carved out on stone.
They can be extended as we forward.
As many of us agree that, they should be well defined and it should be
agreed by cgroup and rdma community.

For example, today we have RDMA_VERB_xxx resources.
New well defined RDMA HW resources can be defined in rdma_cgroup.h
file as RDMA_HW_xx in same enum table.

Can we do (b) now and differ adding any HW resources to cgroup until
they are clearly called out.
Architecture and APIs are already in place to support this.

We can differ adding HW resource to core and cgroup until they are
clearly defined.
In that case current architecture still holds good.

Matan,
Can you please point us to the new RFC/ABI email thread which
describes the design, partitioning of code between core vs hw drivers
etc.
